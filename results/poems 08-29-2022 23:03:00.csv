"In His Lover’s House, A Father Rises",Roxane Beth Johnson,"The end’s always there at the beginning
Dad said, quoting a prophet who knew then
what we’d come to—beings held in two hands
first slick with water, last a bowl of ash.
As a girl, I ironed his shirts, seams stained
from sweat, hot-washed in bleach turned yellow, and grass
scent of clean white rose under the iron’s
scald and steam I used to press his shirts out.
How fitting in the end a heap were found
in his lover’s house, the last I heard
of him who told me always that the grass
and ants were ancestors come back to see
if we’d crush them, then forget them again—
like dust their lives so small compared to ours."
Memoir,Jay Hopler,"Of the two undiscovered countries, Life and Death,
Which one lies the closer to God?"
"Out of These Wounds, the Moon Will Rise",Jay Hopler,"Now that the sun has set and the rain has abated,
And every porch light

in the neighborhood is lit,
Maybe we can invent something; I'd like a new

Way of experiencing the world, a way of taking
Into myself the single light shining at the center

Of all things without losing the dense, eccentric
Planets orbiting around it.

What you'd like is a more
Attentive lover, I suppose—· Too bad that slow,

Wet scorch of orange blossoms floating towards
The storm drain is not a vein of stars . . . we could

Make a wish on one of them; not that we would
Wish for anything but the impossible."
Mend,L. Renée,"My Mama had the gift of hand sewing—one perfect stitch
after another perfect stitch, eyeballing the precise length

of thread needed to repair what had ripped a gaping
hole, unmaking the whole swath of cotton-polyester fabric

she draped across her delicate boney shoulders before
a night out with my father—painting the town red

she said of those early dates when he handed her his fat
quarters hoping they would be enough to make something

beautiful like the outfits she sewed: plaid culottes with matching
vests, paisley dresses, fringed halters—she tells me this while

I watch the needle bully a ruby rivulet from her thumb, sullying
the myth of cotton without the blood, when she tries to mend

my middle-school uniform skirt, a navy pleat I never noticed
had been stretched into splitting—"
Sun to God,Ladan Osman,"The children walked.
Then they began to run.
Why are we running, one asked?
No one knew. They ran faster.
They began laughing.
Why are we laughing?
Not one knew. They laughed more.
It was the eve of war but they didn’t know.
The children walked.
The children’s parents walked.
The parents’ parents walked.
Their shadows spilled ahead.
Their shadows lagged behind.
Then, they began to run.
No one was laughing."
Tender,Jeremy Rock,"Not yet Spring, sunlight barely reaches
past the slider, so I array houseplants
like regents parading before the rabble

and lead with the blades. Just a few snips
before they' re done, cleaned of the veins and petals
that looked ready to come off. It must always

be pruning season, looking at these hands. Sometimes
I sit in the sun with them and drink dayglow slow
with ice water. In red clay I keep the cuttings, sisters

and daughters mudded for new roots, and these
wan stems finally learn to breathe. If not
for the starving of idyllic hamlets, where

would the flowers grow? At night I bring them in
so they can imagine what they're missing."

[I met a man a dying man],Diane Seuss,"I met a man a dying man and I said me too.
Met a dead man and I said me too. Must be
dead cuz the living can’t meet the dead and he
said me too. Did you know the dead can fall
in love he said. Fact. Did you know the dead
fall in love better than the living cuz nothing
left to lose. The root of all blues. Skeptical still
I strode onward in my seven-league boots as in
the fairy tale “Hop-o’-My-Thumb” from a book
of German fairy tales given to me when I had
chicken pox. Scratching myself bloody, the ogre
gored to death by wild beasts. Seven leagues per
stride toward a dead banjo player in a bad
mood. Enchanteur. Or zauberhaft in German."
"[Intimacy unhinged, unpaddocked me]",Diane Seuss,"Intimacy unhinged, unpaddocked me. I didn’t want it.
Believe me, I didn’t want it anymore. Who in their
right mind? And then it came like an ice cream truck
with its weird tinkling music, its sweet frost. I fled
to the shore and saw how death-strewn, all the body
parts washed up and sucked clean like that floor mosaic
by Sosus of Pergamon, Unswept House. Seabirds
flocked and dematerialized like they do. Bees raged
at their own dethroning. Love came close anyway,
found me out, its warped music all the rage. It had
a way, just by being in proximity, of opening
the shells of the bivalves. Disclosing their secret
meat. One doesn’t really suck on frozen sugar water.
One allows it to melt in the oven of the mouth."
"[It is abominable, unquenchable by touch]",Diane Seuss,"It is abominable, unquenchable by touch, closer
to the sublime than sentimental, more animal
than hominid, I’ve seen it in the eyes of birds
weaving on a stem of ragweed, voracious,
singular, there is no one like me, Dickinson in
her narrow bed, her cold clenched hands, her
penmanship unreadable, even following a recipe
for black cake, her black cake came out strange,
lusher than the template, and every freak I ever
met had that same look in their eyes, armless,
threading a needle with their lips and teeth,
legless, rounding a corner on their cerulean cart,
monarchic, imperious, wild, sad, and like every
virgin queen, the need for love revolting and grand."
Vietnam Ghost Story: Đà Lạt Lovers,Hoa Nguyen,"A student at the military school  1956
and a literary teacher at the nearby high school
fall in love       Cute:

each day after school the military student left
a love letter on her door   Thao (an orphan)
wrote back and left a love letter reply on the door
of her small house on the hill

Their love grew like a stack of letters

They were in love and waited
for Thahn to graduate from military school
before living as a couple    officially

Unlike Thao  Thahn is from wealth
and his rich parents insist that
upon graduation  he return home
to the Delta   and marry a local girl of their choosing

Unable to defy them   he does

Thao  devastated  jumps into a lake
drowns  leaves a letter
with instructions to bury her body
near her house and the memories
of her love for Thahn
on the love letter hill

Thahn finds out about her death
goes to war is   killed
and then buried in Đà Lạt
next to his beloved Thao
on the hill   per his written wishes

But
the widow  spurned in death
won't leave it at this

She instructs that his body be removed
and taken back home to the Delta

What a terrible
idea

and now his ghost wanders

Actually
both sites are haunted by their ghosts


and Đà Lạt made the site on the hill
into an attraction you can visit
because why not"
I Am Bound for de Kingdom,Marlanda Dekine,"My granddaddy Silas was born on the Nightingale plantation
in Plantersville, South Carolina, on riverbanks that loved
three generations of my kin, captured
in a green-tinted photograph, hanging in my daddy’s den.

Tonight, my eyes will take each old-world bird from the cropped space,
send them home with their songs and favorite foods.

Look out for me I’m a-coming too

with rice, okra, hard-boiled eggs, and Lord Calvert.

My daddy says if I get out of my car on Nightingale land,
the folks who own it might shoot. My daddy says,
“Never leave the driveway.”

Glory into my soul

I watch all of my ascendants. Their faces reflecting me
in that photograph. Their eyes are dead
black-eyed Susans."
Elegy with Steam,William Fargason,"When I was sick with a head cold, my head
full of pressure, my father would soak a washcloth
in hot water, then ball it up, wring it out. He would
open it above my head, then place it against

my face like a second skin, the light around me
disappearing entirely except through the spaces
between the stitching. I would inhale the steam
in that darkness, hearing his voice on the other side,

otherwise almost devoid of any other bodily sense
but the warmth and depth of his voice, as if
I had already died and was on the other side
of life waiting for the sickness to lift, but I wasn’t.

I was still on this earth, the washcloth going cold
on my face, my body still sick, and my father still
there when I opened my eyes, as he always was,
there to give me warmth before going cold again."
37 El mundo,Esteban Rodríguez,"Even in dreams, your father is working,

and in the version you’d been having for weeks,

he lifts a large replica of the world, places it

on his back, and because his body here defies

logic and physics, carries it up a hill, which,

after you wake up, you know is a metaphor

for twelve-hour shifts, for pounding nails

into wood, for sliding steel into slots again

and again, and for the days when his back

is shaped into a crooked punctuation,

and his feet, marking the floor into a hieroglyph,

have lost more of their purpose, becoming quiet

when he gets home, so that all you see of him

is not comparisons to language, but two

swollen limbs, a body reclined on a La-Z-Boy,

a father relieved to call this silence his own."
The Mystery,Margaret Steele Anderson,"This is your cup—the cup assigned to you
From the beginning. Nay, my child, I know
How much of that dark drink is your own brew
Of fault and passion. Ages long ago—
In the deep years of yesterday,—I knew.

This is your road—a painful road and drear.
I made the stones—that never give you rest;
I set your friend in pleasant ways and clear,
And he shall come, like you, unto my breast;
But you—my weary child!—must travel here.

This is your task. It has no joy nor grace.
But is not meant for any other hand,
And in my universe hath measured place.
Take it; I do not bid you understand;
I bid you close your eyes—to see my face."
杨柳枝词,Bai Juyi,"一树春风千万枝，嫩于金色软于丝。

Taaniwe laakwa?

In Shawnee,
you ask
where in time

as opposed to when

and it helps me

consider folds of territory

tilled by memory and capacity
where the ones I tender
bloom quietly and eternally.

A strain of heirloom corn
roughly translates to the word

sustainer—worlds

that germinate inside such a word;

wild horses, lilting shadows,
glimpsed in the elbows of the hills

like opaque flags of prayer.

My distant kin in Neosho

folded deep indigo beans
into the palm of my hand

and said try them
where you stay.

Within the words of a blessing
in my husband’s language

I recognize through repetition—

The word for city.

The word for garden.

Like an heirloom seed,

I was sown and cultivated
back from the brink.

To rise within

a place in time,

hands sorted
hundreds of seeds;
medicine and sustenance—

pallid disks of immunosuppressants
and steroids.
Flint corn from the Scioto Valley.

All those moments
I shook too hard

to do it myself.

Running a finger

across the slight backs
of trade beads: cornflower blue,

grassgreen, the white-heart red
a fire-flood of sunset.

I feel the shadow
of my aunt’s beading

wringing my neck and wrists.

Spells to protect

my casing gates.

Cerrillos turquoise

threaded into my earlobes.

Intricate blueprints

to the homelands
kept my toes
from the sky ladder’s

sapphire rungs.

Sustainers are all around:

songs chanted
seven states away—glistening exhalations

of devotion and sacrifice,

migrations of breath.

Adorn the skin with glass.

In a place in time

the ground warms and opens—

the hour is right,

stitch a seed and it sustains."
before the dark,Adedayo Agarau,"the antelope’s rib cage, a bridge of  bones at the base of the anthill—
you are outside your father’s house that is outside the city that is
outside the country where a bullet dislodges an infant’s bone—the
owls are learning about the dunes of night, the terrain is full of
widowed birds searching the bark of trees for holes—boys your age
are somewhere afar, before a river waiting to lick them
of their salt—the throes mothers carry in the place you are from
are remembered by the number of  boys who fell off their backs before
they named them—before the dark, the sun is setting the sky on
fire—pink flames burning the clouds, a bird is crashing, the storm
coming carries the face of the people in your dreams where the
antelope elopes with a bullet inside its brain—where your mother
is singing a song the color of wane—the storm is coming & it is
bringing the dark with it—dust comes before the road is forgotten
before the green of august ashes into brown in november—the smell
of rain whets your nose—as you walk inside the house, hope swallows you."

Cada día más cerca del fin del mundo,Anthony Cody,
Cousin Wolf Sings,Ibe Liebenberg,"Her all-night melody blushes
like directions for new lovers
who are lost.

Last night all she held was a hum
that ran away.

She now stretches words in our broken-down car

somewhere on Valley View
between Orphaned Lane
and the dead end,

about hidden roads and streets
of homes for all the abandoned.

I study the map when she falls from crescendo.

Flashlight held by my teeth,
her voice needs
both hands to trace.

She leads me down paths disappearing
into blue lines holding
imaginary rivers,

blacking in thin creases
and folds or contoured lines.

She drones about the water. I find the blue again.
My hand pressed against
the faded shore."
Creation,Franklin K.R. Cline,"A bit packed
up here,
isn’t it? Let’s make the earth.

The beetle’s body shows the world
in ways words can’t.
The water ripples
in ways water can’t.

In the animal’s body
we find ourselves.

In the land, well,
that’s to be decided, ah eh?

There’s a terror in the spread of Dayunisi’s limbs,
in his strange face.
If I didn’t know any better, I’d think those contortions
were a symbol of fear, or confusion.

He’s moving north, and surrounded
(t)here, at the National Museum of the American Indian. We stop
to stare at our own making.

It gets lighter as you look up,
the blue moving north, too, from dark to
light."

Examining the Phytolith,Valerie Wallace,"I saw the ghost of you
nestled within your particular,
who moved among thousands
of thousands of thousands of thousands
in the way that plainlands of grass hide a witness inside

When I first learned you existed
I was reminded how some of us contain
an unborn twin’s tooth in our lining
& this your being seemed to me,
though now I know you are more

a fragment of silica so small as to be particle,
bite of white thread,
caught in daguerreotype mid-wave,
not surrender, but depletion
& therefore, an age-old story

but also a kind of long undetectable,
arrived from a previous downplunge
& now, in ascent, decanting the very earth

I have not been taking what is needed
(becoming smaller, flatter)
I am astonished there is a thing that does only that
—devours—& its particular is unharmed

Little monument, you are
the modified & derived, consequent,
consequence, forgive
all these words; I am trying
to measure something like hereafter

How you remain
& elude—like dirt after rain, a speck of sweet bone,
the tumult of root & tangle, oh

cleft that is left, inspected
for form, for secrets, still
at the end, expelled
from dark & not
the dark"
Field Notes,Tim Tim Cheng,
Finding Home,Jayant Kashyap,"By the border, my passport sticks to my face
like a kiss,           or a slap.

There are women with children who look at me but won’t speak,
because speaking           means worrying,

and our world isn’t made of worrying.

It’s like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesn’t matter
—you’re cold anyway;

or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.

They find their way through the border,
I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know         you.

For years now, I might not know myself without
looking through my bag;

I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,

and I will remember        your name       but not you."
Floaters,Arthur Sze,"Driving past a phalanx of white tombstones
along a south-facing slope,

I recall, “No one hates war like soldiers,”
from a mechanic replacing

an oil pump to a Fiat engine; then another floater
appears when I blink—

peach blossoms on flowing water go
into the distance—

and, as I ponder how a line written in 740
stays present tense—

a curved thrasher nests in a cleft of spined cholla—
a man, on ayahuasca,

types with his hands, and his hands disappear;
he types with his hands,

and his hands disappear—shimmer the words
as his hands disappear."
From the Roof Deck,Carol Moldaw,"From our temporary housing’s rooftop deck,
I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,
the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.
I’d never mistake him for a whooping crane,

but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.
From up here, I get how sharks can mistake
surfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boards
for seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,

but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of  July fireworks
I have to drape myself around the chiminea
and list over the deck’s edge. The display starts
with the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.

No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.
Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried."

Grocery Story,Franklin K.R. Cline,"today i went to the grocery store
and bought several organic fruits

and vegetables so as to keep my health
tip-top i carried the little blue

cherokee card in my wallet
there was a good deal on seltzer

a song played
that reminded me of my ex-wife i paused and cried

by the frozen pizzas then put a frozen pizza
into my cart i walked around the store listening to the music

looking at the cans and stacks the weird
infinite finite nature of the grocery store it was sunny a woman softly

crying by the bread
i am never more alive

than when i am filling up my cart i walked more
and more through ever

-y aisle it came time to put
my things on the conveyor belt and have them

recorded with a satisfying beep then
pull out the small piece of plastic

with all my money on it and give it
to the nice lady who smiled

took my money i didn’t need to give
it to her i should have just walked out and not paid for anything

she gave me my card
back reminded me it needed

to slide into
the computer

which asked a few questions
a man put my things into a bag for me

i got into my car on the stolen land and
on the radio they were discussing

"Hotbeds in Norfolk, Virginia",Ariana Benson,"It’s nothing to be woken by the hammering
racket of collapse. To bathe with tap-
drip the tint of hands’ sun sides. Life
among ruins means something is falling
at all times. Means knowing how long I have
to get out from under a spreading shadow.

Today, they flattened the house across the street
into memory—siding panels rotting like rinds
in the yard’s clovers and crabgrass. It’s constant,
the vinyl harvest: red, yellow, pink—all stripped
to the same blanched flesh. To make a space
more enticing, they say. But I was fed
on sweetness sprung up from dirt, and nobody
skins an apple they intend to candy.

O’Hara wrote, once, about Norfolk.
Said to have exercised here—blown
breath into air, here—is to have been to bed
with a Nigra and what a way to admit knowing
a place only by the way it looks from above,
when on top of it, moving in
and out of it at will.

Last week, they erased the turquoise house,
its kitchen where I learned not to play around
the hot stove, where I earned these scars,
the one my love grazes nightly with lips
brown like water, like mine.
It’s impossible to sleep alone
without the voices I know
better than my own.

Someone silenced the rocks
we used to kick down the blacktop, their scrapes
filling the gaps in conversation. Someone keeps
sticking the same pink slips between my locked door
and its frame. Someone sprayed the big weed
that planted itself in the fractured concrete
before we could even bend our tongues
to dub it   flower. Soon, all the wrong green
will be brought to wilt.

Truth is, there are many Norfolks full
of our deep hotbeds, our colorful plots. It’s nothing
to pass one while driving, to speed up at the first
sign of us: the rubbled lot of a First, or Second,
or Seventh Baptist Church, for instance—
the black dust of its crumbling
never allowed to settle. And so you roll
your windows up, tighten your hold
on your breath."

In the City of Eve,Majda Gama,"i

As a girl I followed my father to our rooftop,
up the narrow stairs, close to his white hem & dark slippers.
The iron steps rang with the striking of our feet.
He carried a telescope, the sky was clear, the moon
in eclipse. The shadow did not bloody
the surface, it smoked across the lunar terrain.
We often stood on the rooftop when the house
was newly built, saw dogs running in the distance
across the packed sand. I asked if they’d be safe;
he said they would look after each other. In
the time since, a thicket of jasmine formed along
the border of our marble yard & the air smelled sweet.

ii

I learned that the names of stars are in Arabic,
constant and loyal, like dogs:
Algol, Arrakis, Deneb, Rigel, Vega.
The skies turn sometimes. On a rooftop,
when sand is loosened from the desert,
it approaches like a red tide & cities drown.
In my time, the deployment of armies would disturb
the deep desert. My father took me to a dirt lot
near the execution square, put me on his shoulders,
and pointed to the ruins there. Do you see the grave of Eve?
The city turned. I have forgotten what I saw in the sand."
Influx—Reservation Lockdown,Max Early,"Turquoise skies blindfold horizon,

Half-filled coffee cup with cream.

Now arriving at Herbal Oshá Balms,

Red-eye flight on Tiffany runway,
pilot shakes moccasin rattle.

Jingle dress dancers revive health
through aisles of canceled powwows.

Distant squash blossom phone calls
from shooting-star ribbon elders

wearing coral silver bead necklaces.
They string bows with damp sinew.

Dove plumes flutter on warm breeze,
a cellular prayer without towers.

He tosses cornhusks over bridge
by floating eagle carcass.

Waterfall trickles through driftwood
skeletons of cholla cactus.

Arroyo creek walls,
what stifles the laughter of an enemy?

Pottery shards crush to sand,
baby blanket sifts uranium bones.

Village of dayrise and sunfall
framed in field of tall wheat.

Windows of abandoned bodies

Interrogation in a Nail Salon,Khải Đơn,"[How long have you been here?]

From the airplane window, she saw dragon’s eyes
floating to sheeny green mangrove feet
its scales a rainbow mirror
dancing light on her mother’s mud wall
Time found its way onto the skin of roofs
she wondered if home remembered
or how it sheltered on the
crumbling field.

[I don’t know your place. What does it look like?]

Her mother’s hair: the white river
Her eyes: the blurred pearls blinking
on heart-lace, staring plumy red nails
crafted waggling American flags

Mekong indulged infant cries, feeding
shining sesban flowers and bitter gourds
Children grew into wandering duckweeds,
intertwining themselves in laughter of joys

The sky was close from Forbidden Mountain
The Goddess sowed brown-eyed seeds
giant tamarind tree cuddled the clouds
little humans played hide-and-seek

A child slips into the mud mouth.

[Do you want to marry someone and get a Green Card?]

Her tiny nipples
wiped out
a flood of silence

Wedding grew thorns on
woven green coconut gate
burning purple on periwinkle blooms

Her body melted
flinching McDonald’s yellow sign
cloudy face powder, acetone, nail polish
Phở broth boiled down particles of her night.

[I know a man, good person, you can marry him.]

She saw herself in the mirror in the corner
toilet of the restaurant at midnight in the
chlorine cloud hallucinating her cracked
fingers. She hid her hands in the janitor
uniform pocket so that any man couldn’t see
how her face was fading into the storm of
keratin dust—spinning manicure drill.

[Don’t worry, nobody knows about your past here.]

Answer: Do you know a service to change bones?

Her past was carved in them
singing through rainy nights
flood season, weeping herons
The Plain of Reeds whined
through teeth mark of rice.

[Do you send a lot of money home?]

Her mother sighed.

[Why?]

A hostage of borders picked shards of memory
and called it home."

survival is silent

It’s not that I haven’t learned

It’s just

Learning about Treaties in School,Jake Skeets,
Lost Jewels,Megha Rao,"Those who have seen me burst into whirling dervishes.
Robes spinning in meditation, they are reborn to my name.

To acknowledge me is to acknowledge the soil. To marvel
at black cardamom, cinnamon, fried okra. To honor the slender
coat of turmeric in the light. To revel in bodies that are not
white marble, but the mane of lions. To drink the perfume of
spices and not burn. To walk on the Bay of Bengal coast and
wear the scent of dried fish—

Because in my land, I am how ittar is made.
Musk, amber, saffron, that’s how I taste.
My skin is a tea garden fresh from the rain.

When he sees me raging through the rubber plantations, the
messenger of the clouds
forgets the damsel he was meant to reach. Kalidasa, the
classical poet, vows to write about me, instead. The earth
forgets to spin around its own axis & begins to circle my waist.

I am the daughter of the Western Ghats.
My throat is the sky.
The sun rises in memory of my golden limbs.

Those who have seen me renounce the world for the
symphony of my anklets. To witness the tapestry of my hair,
rich in silk & coconut oil. Those who have given up stargazing
& silver doors & royal liquor need no horoscopes to believe in
a truth like me—

To know the Taj Mahal has to take but one look at me &
announce that
all her lost jewels have been found."
"Love Shack, Anadarko",Michael Thompson,"In the little tornado alley of their love
he’d become a tarpaper shack
that was pretty much
gettin its ass whipped
all over Oklahoma

her lips’d just ripped him right off the ground
that was one thing

besides which there was a bunch of brindle cows
being tossed around in there
mooing their little heads off
(he suspicioned that those cows might have somethin to do
with the cyclonic powers of her breasts
but hadn’t quite worked out how)

her smile itself  had flung in
a few roosts of free-range chickens and a wringer washer
unstrung half a mile of barbed wire
and churned a buncha shady cottonwoods
into
a spun green blizzard
that was somethin else

they was also assorted metal farm implements
mutant-lookin bladed ones
clangin and awhirlin and crowhoppin in that awful cloud
like 40 drunken sodbusters
from her sweet sashay alone

and somethin else he noticed right off
that high up
her blindin 200 mph prairie dust
sure smelled fine
that and the fact that way way way down on the ground
everbody else looked really really really tiny

but when her pickemup truck started doing 360s and barrel rolls
round and round the inside of that little Midwest love funnel
somebody (maybe it was even him)
was right quick standin
i mean standin
on the horn

didn’t take two shakes before that love shack was popping off nails
like seed corn through a hopper
thank god he’d given up dippin
cause that was no kinda place
to be worried bout a spit cup

why he hadn’t beat a path to the storm cellar
when he’d first looked out the back door
and seen her dark eyes headed his way
was a unsolved mystery to him

when the sound of her voice alone had rattled his plumbin
he shoulda run like hell
when her soft little hand had snuck into his own
like a skinny Comanche snakin after a fat pony
he shoulda dynamited the homestead his ownself
cause the Judgment Day wasn’t far behind

now his very own cowboy boots were boomerangin
in and out his busted windows
and whompin little love knots
all about
his head

plain and simple truth mister
he was caught in her twister
in a bad bad way

in the end wasn’t much left of him
but a few poor splinters

twirling mile high

over
Anadarko"
