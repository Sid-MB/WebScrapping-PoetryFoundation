"In His Lover’s House, A Father Rises",Roxane Beth Johnson,"The end’s always there at the beginning
Dad said, quoting a prophet who knew then
what we’d come to—beings held in two hands
first slick with water, last a bowl of ash.
As a girl, I ironed his shirts, seams stained
from sweat, hot-washed in bleach turned yellow, and grass
scent of clean white rose under the iron’s
scald and steam I used to press his shirts out.
How fitting in the end a heap were found
in his lover’s house, the last I heard
of him who told me always that the grass
and ants were ancestors come back to see
if we’d crush them, then forget them again—
like dust their lives so small compared to ours."
Memoir,Jay Hopler,"Of the two undiscovered countries, Life and Death,
Which one lies the closer to God?"
"Out of These Wounds, the Moon Will Rise",Jay Hopler,"Now that the sun has set and the rain has abated,
And every porch light

in the neighborhood is lit,
Maybe we can invent something; I'd like a new

Way of experiencing the world, a way of taking
Into myself the single light shining at the center

Of all things without losing the dense, eccentric
Planets orbiting around it.

What you'd like is a more
Attentive lover, I suppose—· Too bad that slow,

Wet scorch of orange blossoms floating towards
The storm drain is not a vein of stars . . . we could

Make a wish on one of them; not that we would
Wish for anything but the impossible."
Mend,L. Renée,"My Mama had the gift of hand sewing—one perfect stitch
after another perfect stitch, eyeballing the precise length

of thread needed to repair what had ripped a gaping
hole, unmaking the whole swath of cotton-polyester fabric

she draped across her delicate boney shoulders before
a night out with my father—painting the town red

she said of those early dates when he handed her his fat
quarters hoping they would be enough to make something

beautiful like the outfits she sewed: plaid culottes with matching
vests, paisley dresses, fringed halters—she tells me this while

I watch the needle bully a ruby rivulet from her thumb, sullying
the myth of cotton without the blood, when she tries to mend

my middle-school uniform skirt, a navy pleat I never noticed
had been stretched into splitting—"
Sun to God,Ladan Osman,"The children walked.
Then they began to run.
Why are we running, one asked?
No one knew. They ran faster.
They began laughing.
Why are we laughing?
Not one knew. They laughed more.
It was the eve of war but they didn’t know.
The children walked.
The children’s parents walked.
The parents’ parents walked.
Their shadows spilled ahead.
Their shadows lagged behind.
Then, they began to run.
No one was laughing."
Tender,Jeremy Rock,"Not yet Spring, sunlight barely reaches
past the slider, so I array houseplants
like regents parading before the rabble

and lead with the blades. Just a few snips
before they' re done, cleaned of the veins and petals
that looked ready to come off. It must always

be pruning season, looking at these hands. Sometimes
I sit in the sun with them and drink dayglow slow
with ice water. In red clay I keep the cuttings, sisters

and daughters mudded for new roots, and these
wan stems finally learn to breathe. If not
for the starving of idyllic hamlets, where

would the flowers grow? At night I bring them in
so they can imagine what they're missing."

[I met a man a dying man],Diane Seuss,"I met a man a dying man and I said me too.
Met a dead man and I said me too. Must be
dead cuz the living can’t meet the dead and he
said me too. Did you know the dead can fall
in love he said. Fact. Did you know the dead
fall in love better than the living cuz nothing
left to lose. The root of all blues. Skeptical still
I strode onward in my seven-league boots as in
the fairy tale “Hop-o’-My-Thumb” from a book
of German fairy tales given to me when I had
chicken pox. Scratching myself bloody, the ogre
gored to death by wild beasts. Seven leagues per
stride toward a dead banjo player in a bad
mood. Enchanteur. Or zauberhaft in German."
"[Intimacy unhinged, unpaddocked me]",Diane Seuss,"Intimacy unhinged, unpaddocked me. I didn’t want it.
Believe me, I didn’t want it anymore. Who in their
right mind? And then it came like an ice cream truck
with its weird tinkling music, its sweet frost. I fled
to the shore and saw how death-strewn, all the body
parts washed up and sucked clean like that floor mosaic
by Sosus of Pergamon, Unswept House. Seabirds
flocked and dematerialized like they do. Bees raged
at their own dethroning. Love came close anyway,
found me out, its warped music all the rage. It had
a way, just by being in proximity, of opening
the shells of the bivalves. Disclosing their secret
meat. One doesn’t really suck on frozen sugar water.
One allows it to melt in the oven of the mouth."
"[It is abominable, unquenchable by touch]",Diane Seuss,"It is abominable, unquenchable by touch, closer
to the sublime than sentimental, more animal
than hominid, I’ve seen it in the eyes of birds
weaving on a stem of ragweed, voracious,
singular, there is no one like me, Dickinson in
her narrow bed, her cold clenched hands, her
penmanship unreadable, even following a recipe
for black cake, her black cake came out strange,
lusher than the template, and every freak I ever
met had that same look in their eyes, armless,
threading a needle with their lips and teeth,
legless, rounding a corner on their cerulean cart,
monarchic, imperious, wild, sad, and like every
virgin queen, the need for love revolting and grand."
Vietnam Ghost Story: Đà Lạt Lovers,Hoa Nguyen,"A student at the military school  1956
and a literary teacher at the nearby high school
fall in love       Cute:

each day after school the military student left
a love letter on her door   Thao (an orphan)
wrote back and left a love letter reply on the door
of her small house on the hill

Their love grew like a stack of letters

They were in love and waited
for Thahn to graduate from military school
before living as a couple    officially

Unlike Thao  Thahn is from wealth
and his rich parents insist that
upon graduation  he return home
to the Delta   and marry a local girl of their choosing

Unable to defy them   he does

Thao  devastated  jumps into a lake
drowns  leaves a letter
with instructions to bury her body
near her house and the memories
of her love for Thahn
on the love letter hill

Thahn finds out about her death
goes to war is   killed
and then buried in Đà Lạt
next to his beloved Thao
on the hill   per his written wishes

But
the widow  spurned in death
won't leave it at this

She instructs that his body be removed
and taken back home to the Delta

What a terrible
idea

and now his ghost wanders

Actually
both sites are haunted by their ghosts


and Đà Lạt made the site on the hill
into an attraction you can visit
because why not"
I Am Bound for de Kingdom,Marlanda Dekine,"My granddaddy Silas was born on the Nightingale plantation
in Plantersville, South Carolina, on riverbanks that loved
three generations of my kin, captured
in a green-tinted photograph, hanging in my daddy’s den.

Tonight, my eyes will take each old-world bird from the cropped space,
send them home with their songs and favorite foods.

Look out for me I’m a-coming too

with rice, okra, hard-boiled eggs, and Lord Calvert.

My daddy says if I get out of my car on Nightingale land,
the folks who own it might shoot. My daddy says,
“Never leave the driveway.”

Glory into my soul

I watch all of my ascendants. Their faces reflecting me
in that photograph. Their eyes are dead
black-eyed Susans."
Elegy with Steam,William Fargason,"When I was sick with a head cold, my head
full of pressure, my father would soak a washcloth
in hot water, then ball it up, wring it out. He would
open it above my head, then place it against

my face like a second skin, the light around me
disappearing entirely except through the spaces
between the stitching. I would inhale the steam
in that darkness, hearing his voice on the other side,

otherwise almost devoid of any other bodily sense
but the warmth and depth of his voice, as if
I had already died and was on the other side
of life waiting for the sickness to lift, but I wasn’t.

I was still on this earth, the washcloth going cold
on my face, my body still sick, and my father still
there when I opened my eyes, as he always was,
there to give me warmth before going cold again."
37 El mundo,Esteban Rodríguez,"Even in dreams, your father is working,

and in the version you’d been having for weeks,

he lifts a large replica of the world, places it

on his back, and because his body here defies

logic and physics, carries it up a hill, which,

after you wake up, you know is a metaphor

for twelve-hour shifts, for pounding nails

into wood, for sliding steel into slots again

and again, and for the days when his back

is shaped into a crooked punctuation,

and his feet, marking the floor into a hieroglyph,

have lost more of their purpose, becoming quiet

when he gets home, so that all you see of him

is not comparisons to language, but two

swollen limbs, a body reclined on a La-Z-Boy,

a father relieved to call this silence his own."
The Mystery,Margaret Steele Anderson,"This is your cup—the cup assigned to you
From the beginning. Nay, my child, I know
How much of that dark drink is your own brew
Of fault and passion. Ages long ago—
In the deep years of yesterday,—I knew.

This is your road—a painful road and drear.
I made the stones—that never give you rest;
I set your friend in pleasant ways and clear,
And he shall come, like you, unto my breast;
But you—my weary child!—must travel here.

This is your task. It has no joy nor grace.
But is not meant for any other hand,
And in my universe hath measured place.
Take it; I do not bid you understand;
I bid you close your eyes—to see my face."
杨柳枝词,Bai Juyi,"一树春风千万枝，嫩于金色软于丝。

Taaniwe laakwa?

In Shawnee,
you ask
where in time

as opposed to when

and it helps me

consider folds of territory

tilled by memory and capacity
where the ones I tender
bloom quietly and eternally.

A strain of heirloom corn
roughly translates to the word

sustainer—worlds

that germinate inside such a word;

wild horses, lilting shadows,
glimpsed in the elbows of the hills

like opaque flags of prayer.

My distant kin in Neosho

folded deep indigo beans
into the palm of my hand

and said try them
where you stay.

Within the words of a blessing
in my husband’s language

I recognize through repetition—

The word for city.

The word for garden.

Like an heirloom seed,

I was sown and cultivated
back from the brink.

To rise within

a place in time,

hands sorted
hundreds of seeds;
medicine and sustenance—

pallid disks of immunosuppressants
and steroids.
Flint corn from the Scioto Valley.

All those moments
I shook too hard

to do it myself.

Running a finger

across the slight backs
of trade beads: cornflower blue,

grassgreen, the white-heart red
a fire-flood of sunset.

I feel the shadow
of my aunt’s beading

wringing my neck and wrists.

Spells to protect

my casing gates.

Cerrillos turquoise

threaded into my earlobes.

Intricate blueprints

to the homelands
kept my toes
from the sky ladder’s

sapphire rungs.

Sustainers are all around:

songs chanted
seven states away—glistening exhalations

of devotion and sacrifice,

migrations of breath.

Adorn the skin with glass.

In a place in time

the ground warms and opens—

the hour is right,

stitch a seed and it sustains."
before the dark,Adedayo Agarau,"the antelope’s rib cage, a bridge of  bones at the base of the anthill—
you are outside your father’s house that is outside the city that is
outside the country where a bullet dislodges an infant’s bone—the
owls are learning about the dunes of night, the terrain is full of
widowed birds searching the bark of trees for holes—boys your age
are somewhere afar, before a river waiting to lick them
of their salt—the throes mothers carry in the place you are from
are remembered by the number of  boys who fell off their backs before
they named them—before the dark, the sun is setting the sky on
fire—pink flames burning the clouds, a bird is crashing, the storm
coming carries the face of the people in your dreams where the
antelope elopes with a bullet inside its brain—where your mother
is singing a song the color of wane—the storm is coming & it is
bringing the dark with it—dust comes before the road is forgotten
before the green of august ashes into brown in november—the smell
of rain whets your nose—as you walk inside the house, hope swallows you."

Cada día más cerca del fin del mundo,Anthony Cody,
Cousin Wolf Sings,Ibe Liebenberg,"Her all-night melody blushes
like directions for new lovers
who are lost.

Last night all she held was a hum
that ran away.

She now stretches words in our broken-down car

somewhere on Valley View
between Orphaned Lane
and the dead end,

about hidden roads and streets
of homes for all the abandoned.

I study the map when she falls from crescendo.

Flashlight held by my teeth,
her voice needs
both hands to trace.

She leads me down paths disappearing
into blue lines holding
imaginary rivers,

blacking in thin creases
and folds or contoured lines.

She drones about the water. I find the blue again.
My hand pressed against
the faded shore."
Creation,Franklin K.R. Cline,"A bit packed
up here,
isn’t it? Let’s make the earth.

The beetle’s body shows the world
in ways words can’t.
The water ripples
in ways water can’t.

In the animal’s body
we find ourselves.

In the land, well,
that’s to be decided, ah eh?

There’s a terror in the spread of Dayunisi’s limbs,
in his strange face.
If I didn’t know any better, I’d think those contortions
were a symbol of fear, or confusion.

He’s moving north, and surrounded
(t)here, at the National Museum of the American Indian. We stop
to stare at our own making.

It gets lighter as you look up,
the blue moving north, too, from dark to
light."

Examining the Phytolith,Valerie Wallace,"I saw the ghost of you
nestled within your particular,
who moved among thousands
of thousands of thousands of thousands
in the way that plainlands of grass hide a witness inside

When I first learned you existed
I was reminded how some of us contain
an unborn twin’s tooth in our lining
& this your being seemed to me,
though now I know you are more

a fragment of silica so small as to be particle,
bite of white thread,
caught in daguerreotype mid-wave,
not surrender, but depletion
& therefore, an age-old story

but also a kind of long undetectable,
arrived from a previous downplunge
& now, in ascent, decanting the very earth

I have not been taking what is needed
(becoming smaller, flatter)
I am astonished there is a thing that does only that
—devours—& its particular is unharmed

Little monument, you are
the modified & derived, consequent,
consequence, forgive
all these words; I am trying
to measure something like hereafter

How you remain
& elude—like dirt after rain, a speck of sweet bone,
the tumult of root & tangle, oh

cleft that is left, inspected
for form, for secrets, still
at the end, expelled
from dark & not
the dark"
Field Notes,Tim Tim Cheng,
Finding Home,Jayant Kashyap,"By the border, my passport sticks to my face
like a kiss,           or a slap.

There are women with children who look at me but won’t speak,
because speaking           means worrying,

and our world isn’t made of worrying.

It’s like bathing with cold water on a winter evening, it doesn’t matter
—you’re cold anyway;

or like loving someone on a hot summer afternoon.

They find their way through the border,
I find mine, trying not to recognize faces that might know         you.

For years now, I might not know myself without
looking through my bag;

I will learn to live with the desperate quiet of the morning sand,

and I will remember        your name       but not you."
Floaters,Arthur Sze,"Driving past a phalanx of white tombstones
along a south-facing slope,

I recall, “No one hates war like soldiers,”
from a mechanic replacing

an oil pump to a Fiat engine; then another floater
appears when I blink—

peach blossoms on flowing water go
into the distance—

and, as I ponder how a line written in 740
stays present tense—

a curved thrasher nests in a cleft of spined cholla—
a man, on ayahuasca,

types with his hands, and his hands disappear;
he types with his hands,

and his hands disappear—shimmer the words
as his hands disappear."
From the Roof Deck,Carol Moldaw,"From our temporary housing’s rooftop deck,
I watch seagulls court on the roof next door,
the male cawing, hopping, wings like exhaust flaps.
I’d never mistake him for a whooping crane,

but being amused is (almost) its own comfort.
From up here, I get how sharks can mistake
surfers bobbing upright on their streamlined boards
for seals, the black wetsuits glistening like pelts,

but to catch a glimpse of the 4th of  July fireworks
I have to drape myself around the chiminea
and list over the deck’s edge. The display starts
with the sun, sizzling and sparking as it sinks.

No holiday required for those pyrotechnics.
Or for my burst of waterworks, now air-dried."

Grocery Story,Franklin K.R. Cline,"today i went to the grocery store
and bought several organic fruits

and vegetables so as to keep my health
tip-top i carried the little blue

cherokee card in my wallet
there was a good deal on seltzer

a song played
that reminded me of my ex-wife i paused and cried

by the frozen pizzas then put a frozen pizza
into my cart i walked around the store listening to the music

looking at the cans and stacks the weird
infinite finite nature of the grocery store it was sunny a woman softly

crying by the bread
i am never more alive

than when i am filling up my cart i walked more
and more through ever

-y aisle it came time to put
my things on the conveyor belt and have them

recorded with a satisfying beep then
pull out the small piece of plastic

with all my money on it and give it
to the nice lady who smiled

took my money i didn’t need to give
it to her i should have just walked out and not paid for anything

she gave me my card
back reminded me it needed

to slide into
the computer

which asked a few questions
a man put my things into a bag for me

i got into my car on the stolen land and

"Hotbeds in Norfolk, Virginia",Ariana Benson,"It’s nothing to be woken by the hammering
racket of collapse. To bathe with tap-
drip the tint of hands’ sun sides. Life
among ruins means something is falling
at all times. Means knowing how long I have
to get out from under a spreading shadow.

Today, they flattened the house across the street
into memory—siding panels rotting like rinds
in the yard’s clovers and crabgrass. It’s constant,
the vinyl harvest: red, yellow, pink—all stripped
to the same blanched flesh. To make a space
more enticing, they say. But I was fed
on sweetness sprung up from dirt, and nobody
skins an apple they intend to candy.

O’Hara wrote, once, about Norfolk.
Said to have exercised here—blown
breath into air, here—is to have been to bed
with a Nigra and what a way to admit knowing
a place only by the way it looks from above,
when on top of it, moving in
and out of it at will.

Last week, they erased the turquoise house,
its kitchen where I learned not to play around
the hot stove, where I earned these scars,
the one my love grazes nightly with lips
brown like water, like mine.
It’s impossible to sleep alone
without the voices I know
better than my own.

Someone silenced the rocks
we used to kick down the blacktop, their scrapes
filling the gaps in conversation. Someone keeps
sticking the same pink slips between my locked door
and its frame. Someone sprayed the big weed
that planted itself in the fractured concrete
before we could even bend our tongues
to dub it   flower. Soon, all the wrong green
will be brought to wilt.

Truth is, there are many Norfolks full
of our deep hotbeds, our colorful plots. It’s nothing
to pass one while driving, to speed up at the first
sign of us: the rubbled lot of a First, or Second,
or Seventh Baptist Church, for instance—
the black dust of its crumbling
never allowed to settle. And so you roll
your windows up, tighten your hold
on your breath."

In the City of Eve,Majda Gama,"i

As a girl I followed my father to our rooftop,
up the narrow stairs, close to his white hem & dark slippers.
The iron steps rang with the striking of our feet.
He carried a telescope, the sky was clear, the moon
in eclipse. The shadow did not bloody
the surface, it smoked across the lunar terrain.
We often stood on the rooftop when the house
was newly built, saw dogs running in the distance
across the packed sand. I asked if they’d be safe;
he said they would look after each other. In
the time since, a thicket of jasmine formed along
the border of our marble yard & the air smelled sweet.

ii

I learned that the names of stars are in Arabic,
constant and loyal, like dogs:
Algol, Arrakis, Deneb, Rigel, Vega.
The skies turn sometimes. On a rooftop,
when sand is loosened from the desert,
it approaches like a red tide & cities drown.
In my time, the deployment of armies would disturb
the deep desert. My father took me to a dirt lot
near the execution square, put me on his shoulders,
and pointed to the ruins there. Do you see the grave of Eve?
The city turned. I have forgotten what I saw in the sand."

Interrogation in a Nail Salon,Khải Đơn,"[How long have you been here?]

From the airplane window, she saw dragon’s eyes
floating to sheeny green mangrove feet
its scales a rainbow mirror
dancing light on her mother’s mud wall
Time found its way onto the skin of roofs
she wondered if home remembered
or how it sheltered on the
crumbling field.

[I don’t know your place. What does it look like?]

Her mother’s hair: the white river
Her eyes: the blurred pearls blinking
on heart-lace, staring plumy red nails
crafted waggling American flags

Mekong indulged infant cries, feeding
shining sesban flowers and bitter gourds
Children grew into wandering duckweeds,
intertwining themselves in laughter of joys

The sky was close from Forbidden Mountain
The Goddess sowed brown-eyed seeds
giant tamarind tree cuddled the clouds
little humans played hide-and-seek

A child slips into the mud mouth.

[Do you want to marry someone and get a Green Card?]

Her tiny nipples
wiped out
a flood of silence

Wedding grew thorns on
woven green coconut gate
burning purple on periwinkle blooms

Her body melted
flinching McDonald’s yellow sign
cloudy face powder, acetone, nail polish
Phở broth boiled down particles of her night.

[I know a man, good person, you can marry him.]

She saw herself in the mirror in the corner
toilet of the restaurant at midnight in the
chlorine cloud hallucinating her cracked
fingers. She hid her hands in the janitor
uniform pocket so that any man couldn’t see
how her face was fading into the storm of
keratin dust—spinning manicure drill.

[Don’t worry, nobody knows about your past here.]

Answer: Do you know a service to change bones?

Her past was carved in them
singing through rainy nights
flood season, weeping herons
The Plain of Reeds whined
through teeth mark of rice.

[Do you send a lot of money home?]

Her mother sighed.

[Why?]

A hostage of borders picked shards of memory
and called it home."

Learning about Treaties in School,Jake Skeets,
Lost Jewels,Megha Rao,"Those who have seen me burst into whirling dervishes.
Robes spinning in meditation, they are reborn to my name.

To acknowledge me is to acknowledge the soil. To marvel
at black cardamom, cinnamon, fried okra. To honor the slender
coat of turmeric in the light. To revel in bodies that are not
white marble, but the mane of lions. To drink the perfume of
spices and not burn. To walk on the Bay of Bengal coast and
wear the scent of dried fish—

Because in my land, I am how ittar is made.
Musk, amber, saffron, that’s how I taste.
My skin is a tea garden fresh from the rain.

When he sees me raging through the rubber plantations, the
messenger of the clouds
forgets the damsel he was meant to reach. Kalidasa, the
classical poet, vows to write about me, instead. The earth
forgets to spin around its own axis & begins to circle my waist.

I am the daughter of the Western Ghats.
My throat is the sky.
The sun rises in memory of my golden limbs.

Those who have seen me renounce the world for the
symphony of my anklets. To witness the tapestry of my hair,
rich in silk & coconut oil. Those who have given up stargazing
& silver doors & royal liquor need no horoscopes to believe in
a truth like me—

To know the Taj Mahal has to take but one look at me &
announce that
all her lost jewels have been found."
"Love Shack, Anadarko",Michael Thompson,"In the little tornado alley of their love
he’d become a tarpaper shack
that was pretty much
gettin its ass whipped
all over Oklahoma

her lips’d just ripped him right off the ground
that was one thing

besides which there was a bunch of brindle cows
being tossed around in there
mooing their little heads off
(he suspicioned that those cows might have somethin to do
with the cyclonic powers of her breasts
but hadn’t quite worked out how)

her smile itself  had flung in
a few roosts of free-range chickens and a wringer washer
unstrung half a mile of barbed wire
and churned a buncha shady cottonwoods
into
a spun green blizzard
that was somethin else

they was also assorted metal farm implements
mutant-lookin bladed ones
clangin and awhirlin and crowhoppin in that awful cloud
like 40 drunken sodbusters
from her sweet sashay alone

and somethin else he noticed right off
that high up
her blindin 200 mph prairie dust
sure smelled fine
that and the fact that way way way down on the ground
everbody else looked really really really tiny

but when her pickemup truck started doing 360s and barrel rolls
round and round the inside of that little Midwest love funnel
somebody (maybe it was even him)
was right quick standin
i mean standin
on the horn

didn’t take two shakes before that love shack was popping off nails
like seed corn through a hopper
thank god he’d given up dippin
cause that was no kinda place
to be worried bout a spit cup

why he hadn’t beat a path to the storm cellar
when he’d first looked out the back door
and seen her dark eyes headed his way
was a unsolved mystery to him

when the sound of her voice alone had rattled his plumbin
he shoulda run like hell
when her soft little hand had snuck into his own
like a skinny Comanche snakin after a fat pony
he shoulda dynamited the homestead his ownself
cause the Judgment Day wasn’t far behind

now his very own cowboy boots were boomerangin
in and out his busted windows
and whompin little love knots
all about
his head

plain and simple truth mister
he was caught in her twister
in a bad bad way

in the end wasn’t much left of him
but a few poor splinters

twirling mile high

The Meadow Views: Sword and Symbolic History,Laura Da’,"When skirted by a river’s confluence,
a mountain range, or other natural boundary,
a meadow is an optimal gathering place; lush cradle
with its own established treaty rites
of diplomacy and abundance.

The word meadow’s English etymology
precedes the dissolution of the monasteries
and the routine cadastral measurement of land.
So it leaves a soft cast in the throat,
a taste of Edenic green in its syllables.

Meadow is a woven basket
pressed under epochal currents,
reaping old arrows of hunger,
sifting hard mineral traces of appetite.

A gang of fifty elk saunter
the leeward edge as one body;
the last of the light hemming
across mountain crowns.

The elk press, slow and deliberate,
until the meadow is defined,
a rippling frontier
between their calves
hidden in the marsh grass
and me, walking slowly backwards,
pulses thudding across
the ridges of my fists.

To conceptualize the words
of faith, I was taught to
hold a phantom sword
in my hand and study the verses
by its points.

An allegory of conquest
so simple a child
can understand it.
Is there a sin to avoid?
Is there a promise to believe?
Is there an example to follow?
Is there a command to obey?

Many perceive heaven
in the form of a meadow. The path of righteousness
is carpeted with violet flowers. The open
field symbolizes doctrine; faith is grasses.

I am too close, and have forgotten
that I am a stranger here.
Ochre ripples of hair
crest on the nearest elk.

The crown of my head
is the blade tip pointing
to the dark opal of sky:
What can be inferred about the divine?"

Northbound #23 Bus (Old Indian Trail #2),Yvonne,"Shot myself—clown from circus cannon—

TV refugees—out makeshift movie hall doors—
cold black night hit my face! around—spun—
my solo jubilant Fellini mood—

I’m better? The “articulate” token?
Nomad startup in my own birthplace? Swagger?
Never! Back to my arty misery—Somebody

Thirty years gone—not quite back to home base—
wrecked from the git-go—two stiff-necked teens
choking each other with my first breath—
Here’s Chinatown! Blink—it’s gone! The chase,
always shifting, between assault and defense—
pitfalls, potholes, expressways, or stealth—
Wasn’t this the longest trolley ride
in the world? The world! But a tide

of money rushed in, ripped up tenements,
used-up mansions, and the Black bars shuttered,
jazz scattered, motley vermin stretched survival
like taffy, side by side took up residence

many a song caught gin’s revival
on the downbeat, many a drum knocked
the sting from a devil kiss—white dust rocked—

Stop! That wasn’t my pain. A Dean’s List carpool
drudge. Back then, an Uptown deejay held the spark—

I have resemblanced tattoos echoing cheek to chin, mirrors of denial and

Whiteshell moons escape your teeth in coondog winterness, emergence

a cloud of mosquitoes rose in the clearing;
when the cloud dissipated, you headed
to a temple where you climbed the steps,
and, reaching the pinnacle, surveying
a canopy of ceiba trees, saw other temples
overrun by vegetation. That night, noises
in the rainforest were raspings on guiros—
you saw mosquitoes swarm a bloated
body floating on a lake; and, in the morning,
when you walked out of that rainforest,
bitten alive, you walked out of a past life.

Alive. With Spirit. Animate. Ki wé tes, this land; this pain, this beauty breathes. wá·q’is
is life touching life when I trace the arc of ram’s horn at Buffalo Eddy, memory made in píswe
thousands of years ago. We do not forget. This land is our becoming. Monster’s tim’íne
became rock where he fell, brought down by Coyote, trickster and original rock
star. But not every stone is píswe, nor every story. ’ú·yi·kem is flat rock piled in grief
to cover the graves. Lava rock is your relation who meets you in the sweat

lodge to pray. To purify. All of it is water flowing: tears and song and alloyed sweat,
garlic and booze and betrayal. It speaks through skin. Water dances on rock, hiwaq’iswí·sa:
sweat rocks made of fire. Water hits rock and your body weeps, and grief
flows beyond tears. No refuge when sorrow comes. Thunder shattered píswe,
that’s how he made tipa’x̣líwam. Your life breaks, you too are Split Rock.
Your heart is not made of stone, yet even rocks sunder. Tell this to your tim’íne:

you are stronger than bluff or boulder. More river than rock is our foundation. tim’íne
muscles through. We are never far from Wounded Knee or Alcatraz, our sweat
and song our bond. A Nez Perce inmate escaped The Rock
and received his power from the ocean. That’s waq’í·switki, wá·q’is-
way-of-doing-things. Power becomes medicine. Fire imbues píswe.
We go to The Rock to relive and relieve: songs of loss and hope and grief.

On a fourth grade field trip to Massacre Rocks, we were taught to grieve
for pioneers on the Oregon Trail. Oh to be schooled otherwise! That the tim’íne
of the tiwélqe is as great as land itself, which offers up flint and obsidian for píswe
to flake into knife. I grew up in tewélqem wé:tes, beside the Snake River, happy for sweat
shirts to slip into after a cold swim. The Snake runs through our homelands too; wá·q’is,
despite where it’s been dammed by flat walls of concrete: so·yá·pom/white man’s rock.

Coyote mostly unmade dams. At ’amsáxpa lies his unfinished work, a half row of rock
in a creek. I long for Coyote to unmake the dam at Celilo, to unbury the rock and undo the grief
that has ached our souls since 1957. Celilo is silent but alive: forever wá·q’is.
Some part of my life is underwater. What I would give to hear her voice—my own tim’íne
would I give, to feel the roar of her waters in my blood. No amount of reason or tears or sweat
could stop the destruction. Yet water ever returns. In spring we roast roots on té·mpiswe,

warm cradle of rock in the pit. Mamas rock their babies and words pour from my tim’íne;
this is how we speak, we pray, we grieve. The land births rock and sweat
beads desire. You too are wá·q’is. Hold the vastness in your hand: spirit in blood and píswe."
Upon My Return to Appalachia,Gabriel Dunsmith,"there will be no sorghum in the valleys,
no crawdads or whippoorwills in their hidden places,

nor those stout beams of chestnut lining my grandparents’ fence.
The churches will stand empty by the roadsides,

the blackberry brambles will sag with rotted fruit.
The recipes will be forgotten, the hearth cold.

There will just be the mountains, old and still,
and the sound of someone wailing from the next ridge."
𐓷𐓘𐓧𐓟́𐓺𐓟/Waléze/Stationery,Elise Paschen,
Wavelength // Waveless,Jessica Kim,"Yesterday, eomma called from     halfway     across
the world with news
that she has cancer.
It’s supposed to be a secret,        she whispered
into the phone, her voice quivering like a sparrow—
its earthquake-shaken wings wired         into the telephone buzz.
Earlier, eomma left        for Korea
in search of a new apartment.         Yesterday, she delayed
her flight home by one more month.
In our Californian house, the unwashed spoons
in the left          sink float around
like corpses at sea.
I scavenge for eomma’s silver-soft body
in the pot of abalone porridge,          in the reflections
of rusted silverware, unable to find her thumbprints anywhere.

Eomma says,
the dead will live in the waves of  your palms,
the          hollow         of   your mouth,
but I don’t want her to shrink into low-tide scraps
of flesh that cannot echo my name.
When my brother calls her,
she’s at the hospital waiting for the chemotherapist.
She tells him,      I’m at the beauty salon,
as if cosmetics can     erase     islands of tears
from her face.

——

I grew up by the sea,
witnessing death        after       death
as mackerels perish with the flick of a knife.
At the wet market,
the fishmongers fillet the fish without ever looking down
at their upturned lifelines,         without ever
exhaling psalms of rebirth. Even then, eomma was immune
to decay,          stringing shells into necklaces—
leashes to hold onto bodies
of water.          Water remembers most, she would preach,
her feet baptized in the hush of the waves.
Overhead, planes would wheeze past our heads,
caught in asphyxiation.           Eomma would laugh with eyes
unweathered by age, shouting,
I will never leave my country, my ocean, my daughter,
wrapping me in the briny lyrics of the foaming tides.

Even now, with eomma in Korea,          I ask for comfort
in the waves that have carried her over to America—
waves bleached white with fatigue,           a receding
hairline. How her skin yellows into wallpapers
at the hospital ward.         At night,
I can’t help but stare at the goosebumps on the ceiling
that resemble a sea of faces
disfigured by the gravitational pull of time, of moonless nights.
The nightmares about eomma         metamorphose into
a reality—sweat pooling around her body
in the middle of the night, her face shrinking into medicine pills,
her throat unable to swallow        back her saltwater tears,
stinging and wearing away her skin.

——

In our house, we mention surgery
more frequently than         survival,
unaccustomed to the language of loss.
From halfway across the world,
I hear the rupture in eomma’s voice,
split open like the red sea.          Outside, the sky bloodied
by eomma’s spasms—the sky raining teeth.
For the first time,
I notice death in the negative space behind my body—
and not just in the imaginary universes in my poems.
The mirrors grayed at their corners
and mold bloating into malignant tumors on the bedroom walls.
Day by day, eomma masters the art of falling—
teeth, hair, obsidian tears.          I am yearning for a surgeon
who can stitch back the wounds of this world,
yearning for a miracle
that will never wash up on our shore.
See, only the formless bodies are attracted to the ocean,
the ones wrinkled by imminent death.
In the end, eomma was wrong:
water does not remember,
nor does it          heal.
Water hungers, draining her life out            in metastasis."
we acknowledge ourselves,Allison Akootchook Warden,"before we bring this meeting to order
we want to acknowledge ourselves, the Kaktoviġmiut
yes, Siliun, this is how they are doing things nowadays
we are doing it right

we acknowledge ourselves, the Kaktoviġmiut
we are the people of this island and of the mountains and lands around us
and all our traditional hunting areas

since before the military came
and bulldozed our old sod houses our entire village
so they could make a runway and yes we are still angry about that
and we are still wanting reparations for what they did
they finally did take that hangar down and it

looks better without that big old thing on there
and I know we are still looking for
what was lost in the nuna on that day
what they did was wrong

and we are still here

and even though the military still today has that huge other hangar
on the other side with that
military man
who lives in there that we have
never met
and the other that relieves him every three weeks or so

we were here before
 they put those big humongous radar ears up       
and then took them down   
and yes they left many barrels and still never got all of them
we all want all their residue
to be
off our island forever

we were here before
the government started drawing arbitrary lines
encasing us into this wildlife refuge
without our full knowledge or consent

where strangers break into our cabins on our own land
up in the mountains each and every year
no matter how many signs we put or what kind of locks we use
and because of these borders not our own
we cannot hunt the way
our relatives in other
villages hunt

we have more restrictions and regulations than the others
yet we still are able to get the food we need
around the land we care for and know

ii, we are still fighting these arbitrary borders and lines today, thank you Ekowan
and also thank you aŋaaluk for those letters you put out
they needed to see that

and all of us fighting for our ways of life and as we continue to fight
even in this strange language
we had to learn to fight them with
arii, piliaqsuŋa taniktun uqaġama

we acknowledge our Elders that are still on this land
and our Ancestors                               buried just over there and over there too

and our own people who are still living here
especially the little ones like Uqumaiḷaq here
and all our future relatives yet to be born

we acknowledge and remember
that the military did experiments without our consent
on our Elders when they were kids
and the government has never owned up to these injustices

but we remember what was done

and yes some Elders did get compensated for that radioactive iodine they put in their veins
yet not for the other forced experiments

and we remember how we were also made to send our young people away
to go to school
and how they came back
having to relearn their own language
and many of them left right away again

yet many stayed home
and the others always return
and belong home here

we the Kaktoviġmiut remember how we have always been whole

nakuurugut
we are good we have always been good
living here in the ways taught to us by our Elders
and our Elders’ Elders’ Elders

and even though there were two waves of diseases that we didn’t know
how to fight
naturally
we lost many of our people
yet many of us survived
those waves

and since we are talking about these things in a community hall meeting
might as well mention the alcohol that came to kill us
and the cancers that we can guess where those came from too
and the fog of smoke and qaaq that has stayed and lingered

and I know that we aren’t used to acknowledging ourselves
but when me and Fannie went to the big meeting in Anchorage
they did one of these

land acknowledgments
so apparently everyone is starting to remember

and we remember too
how to acknowledge one another
and how we remember our relatives and how we are related
we remember how to sing and dance and how to take care of
the land

because we need to acknowledge our young people too
even the ones who are pretending they don’t understand
or can’t talk yet
we know you are paying attention

yet we also want to say the young ones have also been having a lack of
listening
and they need to fix that right now

oh and of course
our relationship to the animals
the aġviq, the tuttu, the fish, the nanuk, the qavvik
oh yes and the aiviq and the beluga whale
and I know I am forgetting some animals thank you Ukpik

and we were here before the tourists started to travel here to see our
polar bears
without giving back to our community
and yes we are starting to regulate those tourists too
as a community
working together

yes the amaġuq and I know we have too many animals to mention right now
and we need to get started with these door prizes soon
yet let me say one more time
because I see that Michael just came in the door

we the Kaktoviġmiut acknowledge ourselves
sovereign here on our own land
sovereign here forevermore

despite all of these other ways
in which they thought they could make us forget
or think we were broken

we are whole and good and we remember all of it
an unbroken line
going all the way
all the way
all the way
back

from the time before the time before
nakuurugut
we are the Kaktoviġmiut, the original people of this place
we have never ceded our lands
we always remember our long long long ago ways

that we are living even today and even though we are thankful for many
modern tools
that we put to use in the ways that our Elders agree with
the outsiders’ ways are not our ways
we belong here
and on our mountains and all the places near that we travel for food
and on the ocean

we remember who we are

today and forevermore
we acknowledge ourselves
in our power as Iñupiaq
aulayaiqsimarugut Kaktoviġmiut
tavra!

now Alasuuraq will draw the first prize because I believe he is our oldest
Elder here
we will draw a couple few more door prizes
now at the start
and then the rest at the end of the meeting
I know we have a lot to talk about"
A White Man in the Audience Said I Owed Him,Krysten Hill,"not because I was a Black woman, but because I was a poet
and he was a reader, and he needed me to explain

how some things are inseparable. My great-grandmother
nourished her family on a love she tended

on land she didn’t own. Some things grew inside of her,
and some refused to. Her life was meant to pay a debt.

Here I was in a room, trying to clarify what could make scars
timeless, sealed mouths floating across generations.

Someone is always trying me when they get offended,
putting their fingers in my truth to examine the quality of my teeth.

My great-grandmother never said a lot with her mouth. I should’ve paid
more attention when she gave her words away.

She carried a debt that meant you earned her laughter,
would turn away, humming gospel at the hint of a stupid question.

When generous, she gave a look that told a lesson,
taught me how to read the world in what goes unsaid.

There has to be something I don’t owe anyone.
I’m glad there are stories that died with her."
Women are cooking outside over the fire,Michelle Whitstone,"Women are cooking outside.

They are slapping the dough around and gazing at each other.

They look around every now and then.

They are probably watching their children and grandchildren, as they cook.

They are talented mothers.

Even their breadmaking is done with great care.

Their tortillas don’t have big lips.

Their tortillas don’t even have holes in them.

Scarf,Rita Dove,"Whoever claims beauty

by a child

The Peach,Alice Friman,"I stood on a corner eating a peach,
the juice running down my arm.
A corner in Pergos where he left me,
Pergos where I could catch a bus.
What was I supposed to do now
alone, my hands sticky with it
standing on the corner where he
left me a Greek peach, big as a softball,
big as an orange from Spain, but it
wasn’t from Spain, but from Pergos,
where I could see his red truck
disappear around a corner, not
my corner but further up the street,
and only later, months later, back
home when the trees were slick
with ice, their topmost branches
shiny as swords stabbing the heart
out of the sky, the earth chilled under
snowdrifts or as we tend to say, sleeping.
But I don’t know, frozen maybe, numb?"
Fairy Tale,Amorak Huey,"My father cuts off his thumb with a circular saw.
A tiny magical man makes me an offer.

I cannot refuse. My father’s thumb grows back.
The price I have agreed to pay is too great;

I cannot bear to say its name aloud. In the corner
of every room I enter, the tiny magical man

crouches, nameless and cruel. Not today, he says.
Not today. One day, I will enter a room and he will

not be there, and I will know the bill has come due.
A phone will ring. I will answer. A stranger’s voice

will mispronounce my name, apologize,
hesitate. In this brief silence, foolish hope will bloom."
Doing the Bills,Lee Upton,"My father impaling bills
on a nail on a block of wood
then putting his head in his hands
and you with your head in your hands
and my head in my hands
hands over my eyes
and I see again what I forgot for decades
my father
after doing the bills
crumbling bread in a bowl
and pouring milk over the bread
and spooning in sugar."
"Portrait of Pink, or Blush",Adrienne Christian,"when today at a bistro
an elderly couple in jeans, leather
bomber jackets, and heeled boots
stepped down from their stools
to stand and go home—

him behind her,
his bomber jacket zipper
a spine at her back,
him wrapping on her scarf

the heart-shaped cookie she nibbled
the shape of her mouth,
that cookie, puffy,
with still-soft icing white and rose—

I learned
the anthropology of blush"

Black Woman Selling Her Home in America,Patricia Jabbeh Wesley,"After the show, I can reenter my home
and take myself  back.
From room to room, I examine my home
to see if the possible buyers
did not take a piece of shredded
carpet with them, did not pull down a window blind,
and yes, the television is still standing.

But through the box walls, I feel their fingernails
rising out of the corners of my rooms,
their presence, these strangers, these spies,
these unknown people who have walked
through my home,
have touched my private places in my home,
done this abominable thing of touring

my bedroom, my sleeping place, where at night
I revisit my ancestors
over and over. My bedroom, where I can steal
away at night and meet
my mother in the other world.
In my country, you do not sell your home.
You do not sell your home to strangers.

You do not move away so others can possess
your possessions. You plant feet
and umbilical cords deep. I have been
selling my home for a year now.
I have been selling myself for years now,
and my possible buyers do not seem to see
the house they cannot see.

Sometimes I wish my home was not as black
as me, that the skin
of my aluminum sidings were not gray
or black like me. After the show,
I come back home, walking like a broken
woman. I walk in fearfully,
letting myself into my own home

in small particles of dust. I walk in like
you walk into a haunted house,
holding onto foot and arm. Sometimes, I can
see their large eyes, these buyers, who
walk in with ugly coats, who come in,
their prying eyes, afraid something may spring
at them when they finally move into my home."
Bodhisattvas at the Beach in November,Monica Sok,"You can bring half that Gouda in your fridge if you want.

I’ll bring a persimmon, my cutting board, and knife.

But first golden chrysanthemums at the farmers market, cut at the stem
and wrapped in butcher paper.

What about this olive bread—Oh yes, get this olive bread. Cash only.
Do you have cash? All right, fine. I have cash.

On 580 toward San Francisco, we talk about the imbecile men
who have rejected us lately.

Sister, sex is nothing to be embarrassed about.

Sister, the more  you tell me about him the less I like him.

Hold my hand as we descend this hill of sand and hidden rocks.

Bodhisattvas at the beach are each other’s bitches but not everybody’s,
though we vow to return many lifetimes
until not one being is suffering, not even one blade of grass.

Let’s lay the mat somewhere—you pick a spot—and drink margaritas.

You change from hiking boots into sandals and bare feet.
I still have on my socks. Bitches don’t get cold.

1 sliced apple, 4 dates, 2 mandarins, a few square coconut crackers—
the kind that comes stale,
the kind my mom buys and leaves in my cupboard.

I  feel really bad for your mom. I mean ... I  feel really bad for my mom too!

A white dog walks up to us. A black dog sits next to our shoes.
They go when their owners call them back.

Next time I want a basket to bring to the beach. What kind of basket?
A wicker basket with a lid.

Oh and a separate basket for the wine bottle and wine glasses.
I want a basket for fruit. I want that too.

You and I with separate lighters burn incense sticks,
our bodies huddling over the flames
to keep them going against November wind.

I’m done praying before you’re done praying.

Bitch, I’m envious that you’re still praying.

As you chant to yourself quietly, as the scent of sandalwood snakes toward us,
I lie down watching two tiny crustaceans from wet sand
skip onto the mat.

What is your purpose? Do you mean my purpose in life ? I’m a bodhisattva.
I am too. I know.

I’m not here to change anybody. Or tell anybody what’s best for them.

I know why the sun is out today. Because yesterday it rained.

Are you sure you want to wear boots? Instead of your sandals?
I’m rolling up my pants to walk to the water.
Whatever we try to prevent from happening, will happen.

The tide rushes toward us. It knows we are here.

Now my pants are wet up to my calves
and your boots are completely soaked,
but the chrysanthemums are floating in the ocean.

Our small offering.

I love you. I love you too.

Let me put on my socks and sneakers to climb the steep hill with you,
huffing and puffing, and not without laughter.

I’m getting better at accepting myself and others and the way things are.

Look at the sunset beyond the pink ice plants. Yes, I see.

Look at this spray-painted bench high off the ground. It has character.
If you say so. Character.

The air smells like basil. Or mint. I told you this in the beginning
when we first got here. It’s eucalyptus.

I can’t remember the last time I held someone’s hand. Bitch, it was me.
In January. Before lockdown.

It seemed like a lifetime ago. It was many lifetimes ago."
Bubu the Bunny,Qiang Meng,"My girlfriend adopts a rabbit,
and we name him Bubu Dostoevsky Luo.
Luo is my girlfriend’s last name.
Luo bu means radish in Chinese.
Dostoevsky is a writer I like.

Bubu never writes in the first month,
although his modest nose twitching
implies a burning interest in language.

My girlfriend and I speak Chinese at home
but feel obliged to rethink this practice
like every immigrant household:

She points out that Bubu
is an American bunny,
and he needs to fit into society.

Poor Bubu. Will he grow up ignorant of the story
behind the Mooncake Festival,
meaning of his own name,
locations of Beijing and Shanghai—
which one is farther north?
And Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu
where people cook (Bubu should be aware!)
spicy marinated rabbit heads.

Do we take Bubu to church on Sunday?
Wedding ceremony sans fresh longans,
grave adorned with a cute wood cross?

Other bunnies carrying Easter egg baskets
may ask Bubu to talk about his family.
What will they call Bubu in his absence?
How does Bubu see himself?

In the long 21st century, Bubu may meet
some communist bunny from China.
Will Bubu return her accented greeting
with a perplexed smile,
or will they sniff and pass each other—
a fluffy moon at its perigee?

Yes, Bubu is born so American
he can easily run for president.
Thank God he hasn’t expressed a zeal
for proposing tax reforms
or deporting Russian spies.

Bubu munches orchard hay.
From behind I see a fierce typist at work.
The paper balls he throws away
hang in the sky as crumpled clouds.

Or is Bubu an underground radio operator,
who keeps sending the Morse code of wonder
(now his antennae ears are up)
to somewhere far, far away?

No matter which language Bubu the bunny
adopts to write his early oeuvre,
we will always love him, support him, and make sure
he doesn’t travel alone to Chengdu."
Claws of the Sea,Madeleine Wattenberg,
Dream of Low Houses,Max Schleicher,"I was there; and the river
was there everywhere;
in the glue
of dead leaves and dew stuck to its shores;
in the cracked cement sides;
in the old valley walls
widened by quarries that are gone now
and quarrymen that are gone now too;
in the roads;
in the snail tracks;
in the accumulations
of stringed earplugs; in curbside cigarettes
left from graveyard shifts;
in low houses with plastic
on front windows
to seal themselves from foundry dust;
in the explosion at Falk
Corporation that dented the fire station door
a mile and a half away;
in the fish
flat as butter knives that die gasping
after following big ships
from north on the Lake,
(dying
they are not used to the warmth
of the harbor);
in the coyote that limps in the quarry carveout
to sun himself on Christmas morning;
in the fox that eats the birds that die
frozen to the Lake in a snap; and in the light
that seems to change monthly
though I know it never
changes in that way.

I was there
with a friend
at the Protestant shelter
that gave us food for believing
we were not to blame for the state of our lives
and for accepting the state of  Lord  Jesus Christ
as we prayed and slept in a dormitory with 20
bunks full of men flatulent or masturbating
and I saw the invisible heart of  Jesus Christ
like a  jellyfish it stung me
like ticks I had it
in the seams of my jeans
like an arrowhead it dug into the flesh above
my ankle. And I told Jesus, listen, if you come by me
use the side door or the back, never the front,
the side or the back is for family."
The End of Crisis,Cindy Juyoung Ok,"When you leap over the deer carcasses
that line every garden, you will marvel
at their tidiness, at how bloodless a death
by drought can be. When I crawl through
the highway pieces shattered by heat,
I will admire the clean slits as I kick
aside crumbles of broken stone with little
blistering. When you thread between
the overtaken shores and bodies of elders,
frozen, when I follow the fallen saplings’
directions toward the horizon where
colorless sky and earth meet, we will
remember rippling at the birthday parties
for corporations and framing the ash
of beloved photos burnt in wildfire. When
we think of crossing the river to each
other, you from the gorge of the landslide
to me at the crest of the typhoon, it is then
we will find ourselves in a dead imaginary,
in some fictive past where the  you exists,
where I   is not a myth we use to keep
surviving at the cost of bird and glacier,
home and tenderness. Having ruined
the future of  becoming fossils, finally
we will know that it is for nothing we
die, never in place of drowned sea
turtles or swarming locusts, or to foil
cancerous sand and mold, not even for
the dance of subway floods or the graceless
eclipse of all our promises and planets."

 Dicen que su declarante, Juan de Oñate y Salazar, esperaba encontrar otras
riquezas —las riquezas de otros— , superiores a las de los mexica al sur.
  
 
 Y un año después, sus soldados demandaron de los acoma los

Flyway,Romeo Oriogun,"There is no light that holds the dead
in beauty like the light before nightfall,
that evening abundance of grace
luring the wild geese to stop on their way
to Mexico, bringing all that is gone
into a moment of homecoming.
I had walked through it once.
It was December, the cold was beginning,
and here in Ames, Africans at the crossroad
of life, refugees and migrants, were getting
ready to meet at a makeshift bar assembled
in a basement and named after a famous donkey
in Khartoum, so they said, where the rhumba
would wild out of speakers and we would seek
what those at crossroads seek: touch and joy,
sight and the safety of bodies. I had taken
my time before getting on the bus heading
to the bar. Walking down Coconino,
the dogs were out, blades of grass faded,
man-made lakes were filled with geese like airports
on water. Even in the midst of so much beauty
there is no place that will save us. Our destination
is between suffering and joy, everything else is a road
filled with unending patience. And even I, a nomad,
who has witnessed so much of the world,
will be forgotten before I reach the veranda
of my homeland, and yet as I watched the last light
of evening, waiting for the bus, I saw them, the dead,
descending on wings, joining the birds to play
in water like little children, laughing into joy,
and then they were gone. All that was left
was the only freedom we could speak without shame,
the weather, winter, the harmony of all things."

Healing Will Come: Elegy after Natural Disaster,Patricia Jabbeh Wesley,"She searches the ruins like someone
who has wandered so far away.

Six children, I had six children,
she tells herself. All around, her world
has become twigs of splintered pieces
of a long-ago life,
not so long ago.

She lays down one child alongside another
child, alongside another,
but then, she stands there, wiping her
eyes, looking ahead, turning over

the ruins of pieces of a place that once
was, in the ruins of a life that once was.
But they were six children, she says,
six, dead, or alive.

A mother knows what it means
to have six, not three, but six living
children, not three only, dead,
and there, the tears, calming for now,
calming, for now.
Always.

What would I do without tears,
I used to ask myself in another world.
What would she do without tears,
I now ask myself, and now,
the water from her eyes, unlike
the water that has taken
everything away with it.

Somewhere, always, somewhere,
there’s a day when healing comes.
Wasn’t this what life was supposed to bring,
after death, the healing?
Healing refuses to be lost to death,
I say, healing will come."

it wasn’t my mother whom I’d spoken about—
all this without you suspecting me,

I’d like to think. I’ve whispered Te quiero to actually mean
I want you. I had to use a  Japanese word, ginko, to explain
in English my first time seeing the splitting yellow
fans of eun-haeng leaves in Korea.

There’s so much of the past in these
choices. Let me tell you

how I wished for a long, unfractured life:
I slurped noodles, threaded
needles. But again and again I dreamt
I was a series of footprints
pressed deep into the earth, covered in snow.

I told my parents about this, saying:

Red Meat: Fragments of Stesichoros,Anne Carson,"I. GERYON

Geryon was a monster everything about him was red
Put his snout out of the covers in the morning it was red
How stiff the red landscape where his cattle scraped against
Their hobbles in the red wind
Burrowed himself down in the red dawn jelly of Geryon's
Dream

Geryon's dream began red then slipped out of the vat and ran
Upsail broke silver shot up through his roots like a pup

Secret pup At the front end of another red day



II. MEANWHILE HE CAME

Across the salt knobs it was Him
Knew about the homegold
Had sighted red smoke above the red spires



III. GERYON'S PARENTS

If you persist in wearing your mask at the supper table
Well Goodnight Then they said and drove him up
Those hemorrhaging stairs to the hot dry Arms
To the ticking red taxi of the incubus
Don't want to go want to stay Downstairs and read



IV. GERYON'S DEATH BEGINS

Geryon walked the red length of his mind and answered No
It was murder And torn to see the cattle lay
All these darlings said Geryon And now me



V. GERYON'S REVERSIBLE DESTINY

His mother saw it mothers are like that
Trust me she said Engineer of his softness
You don't have to make up your mind right away
Behind her red right cheek Geryon could see
Coil of the hot plate starting to glow



VI. MEANWHILE IN HEAVEN

Athena was looking down through the floor
Of the glass-bottomed boat Athena pointed
Zeus looked Him



VII. GERYON'S WEEKEND

Later well later they left the bar went back to the centaur's
Place the centaur had a cup made out of a skull Holding three
Measures of wine Holding it he drank Come over here you can
Bring your drink if you're afraid to come alone The centaur
Patted the sofa beside him Reddish yellow small alive animal
Not a bee moved up Geryon's spine on the inside



VIII. GERYON'S FATHER

A quiet root may know how to holler He liked to
Suck words Here is an almighty one he would say
After days of standing in the doorway
NIGHTBOLLSNORTED



IX. GERYON'S WAR RECORD

Geryon lay on the ground covering his ears The sound
Of the horses like roses being burned alive



X. SCHOOLING

In those days the police were weak Family was strong
Hand in hand the first day Geryon'ş mother took him to
School She neatened his little red wings and pushed him
In through the door



XI. RIGHT

Are there many little boys who think they are a
Monster? But in my case I am right said Geryon to the
Dog they were sitting on the bluffs The dog regarded him
Joyfully



XII. WINGS

Steps off a scraped March sky and sinks
Up into the blind Atlantic morning One small
Red dog jumping across the beach miles below
Like a freed shadow



XIII. HERAKLES' KILLING CLUB

Little red dog did not see it he felt it All
Events carry but one



XIV. HERAKLE'S ARROW

Arrow means kill It parted Geryon's skull like a comb Made
The boy neck lean At an odd slow angle sideways as when a
Poppy shames itself in a whip of Nude breeze



XV. TOTAL THINGS KNOWN ABOUT GERYON

He loved lightning He lived on an island His mother was a
Nymph of a river that ran to the sea His father was a gold
Cutting tool Old scholia say that Stesichoros says that
Geryon had six hands and six feet and wings He was red and
His strange red cattle excited envy Herakles came and
Killed him for his cattle

The dog too

They say that the name Texas comes from the Hasinai language:
from the word táysha’, which means “friend.”
  
 
 They say it was used as a greeting between friends.
  
 
 And the Hasinai were expelled from the State of Texas in 1859.

They say that the name New Mexico was first declared on July 12th, 1598, at
the confluence of the Chama and the Rio Grande.
  
 
 They say that Juan de Oñate y Salazar, who declared it, hoped to find other
riches—others’ riches—greater than those of the Mexica to the south.
  
 
 And one year later, his soldiers demanded from the Acoma the supplies
 
necessary to survive the winter.                                                 
 
And when they resisted because ceding to the demand would mean      
 
accepting their own death, Oñate decreed the murder of 800 of the      
 
Acoma, the enslavement of the remaining 500 women and children,      
 
and the amputation of the right foot of the 80 surviving men.                 
  
 
 They say that the wounded antelope will keep walking until it collapses in
the sand.
  
 
 And in 1997 in the city of Alcalde, the Friends of Acoma amputated        
 
Oñate’s bronze foot, still adorned with spur and stirrup.










They say that the name Arizona comes from the O’odham language:
from the word alĭ ṣonak, which means “small spring.”

And almost half of the remains scattered across the immense
barrier of the desert are found in the territory of the Tohono
O’odham Nation.

They say that it originally referred to the Bolas de Plata region, brief pride
of the Spaniards during the first half of the eighteenth century, today a few
kilometers south of the border.

And the majority of their deaths are caused by exposure to
the elements, exhaustion, and lack of drinkable water.

They say that it’s an official strategy to push migrants into the most
unforgiving territories.

And agents are taught to trample the caches of water stashed
there by volunteers.

Black Woman Selling Her Home in America,Patricia Jabbeh Wesley,"After the show, I can reenter my home
and take myself  back.
From room to room, I examine my home
to see if the possible buyers
did not take a piece of shredded
carpet with them, did not pull down a window blind,
and yes, the television is still standing.

But through the box walls, I feel their fingernails
rising out of the corners of my rooms,
their presence, these strangers, these spies,
these unknown people who have walked
through my home,
have touched my private places in my home,
done this abominable thing of touring

my bedroom, my sleeping place, where at night
I revisit my ancestors
over and over. My bedroom, where I can steal
away at night and meet
my mother in the other world.
In my country, you do not sell your home.
You do not sell your home to strangers.

You do not move away so others can possess
your possessions. You plant feet
and umbilical cords deep. I have been
selling my home for a year now.
I have been selling myself for years now,
and my possible buyers do not seem to see
the house they cannot see.

Sometimes I wish my home was not as black
as me, that the skin
of my aluminum sidings were not gray
or black like me. After the show,
I come back home, walking like a broken
woman. I walk in fearfully,
letting myself into my own home

in small particles of dust. I walk in like
you walk into a haunted house,
holding onto foot and arm. Sometimes, I can
see their large eyes, these buyers, who
walk in with ugly coats, who come in,
their prying eyes, afraid something may spring
at them when they finally move into my home."
Bodhisattvas at the Beach in November,Monica Sok,"You can bring half that Gouda in your fridge if you want.

I’ll bring a persimmon, my cutting board, and knife.

But first golden chrysanthemums at the farmers market, cut at the stem
and wrapped in butcher paper.

What about this olive bread—Oh yes, get this olive bread. Cash only.
Do you have cash? All right, fine. I have cash.

On 580 toward San Francisco, we talk about the imbecile men
who have rejected us lately.

Sister, sex is nothing to be embarrassed about.

Sister, the more  you tell me about him the less I like him.

Hold my hand as we descend this hill of sand and hidden rocks.

Bodhisattvas at the beach are each other’s bitches but not everybody’s,
though we vow to return many lifetimes
until not one being is suffering, not even one blade of grass.

Let’s lay the mat somewhere—you pick a spot—and drink margaritas.

You change from hiking boots into sandals and bare feet.
I still have on my socks. Bitches don’t get cold.

1 sliced apple, 4 dates, 2 mandarins, a few square coconut crackers—
the kind that comes stale,
the kind my mom buys and leaves in my cupboard.

I  feel really bad for your mom. I mean ... I  feel really bad for my mom too!

A white dog walks up to us. A black dog sits next to our shoes.
They go when their owners call them back.

Next time I want a basket to bring to the beach. What kind of basket?
A wicker basket with a lid.

Oh and a separate basket for the wine bottle and wine glasses.
I want a basket for fruit. I want that too.

You and I with separate lighters burn incense sticks,
our bodies huddling over the flames
to keep them going against November wind.

I’m done praying before you’re done praying.

Bitch, I’m envious that you’re still praying.

As you chant to yourself quietly, as the scent of sandalwood snakes toward us,
I lie down watching two tiny crustaceans from wet sand
skip onto the mat.

What is your purpose? Do you mean my purpose in life ? I’m a bodhisattva.
I am too. I know.

I’m not here to change anybody. Or tell anybody what’s best for them.

I know why the sun is out today. Because yesterday it rained.

Are you sure you want to wear boots? Instead of your sandals?
I’m rolling up my pants to walk to the water.
Whatever we try to prevent from happening, will happen.

The tide rushes toward us. It knows we are here.

Now my pants are wet up to my calves
and your boots are completely soaked,
but the chrysanthemums are floating in the ocean.

Our small offering.

I love you. I love you too.

Let me put on my socks and sneakers to climb the steep hill with you,
huffing and puffing, and not without laughter.

I’m getting better at accepting myself and others and the way things are.

Look at the sunset beyond the pink ice plants. Yes, I see.

Look at this spray-painted bench high off the ground. It has character.
If you say so. Character.

The air smells like basil. Or mint. I told you this in the beginning
when we first got here. It’s eucalyptus.

I can’t remember the last time I held someone’s hand. Bitch, it was me.
In January. Before lockdown.

It seemed like a lifetime ago. It was many lifetimes ago."
Bubu the Bunny,Qiang Meng,"My girlfriend adopts a rabbit,
and we name him Bubu Dostoevsky Luo.
Luo is my girlfriend’s last name.
Luo bu means radish in Chinese.
Dostoevsky is a writer I like.

Bubu never writes in the first month,
although his modest nose twitching
implies a burning interest in language.

My girlfriend and I speak Chinese at home
but feel obliged to rethink this practice
like every immigrant household:

She points out that Bubu
is an American bunny,
and he needs to fit into society.

Poor Bubu. Will he grow up ignorant of the story
behind the Mooncake Festival,
meaning of his own name,
locations of Beijing and Shanghai—
which one is farther north?
And Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu
where people cook (Bubu should be aware!)
spicy marinated rabbit heads.

Do we take Bubu to church on Sunday?
Wedding ceremony sans fresh longans,
grave adorned with a cute wood cross?

Other bunnies carrying Easter egg baskets
may ask Bubu to talk about his family.
What will they call Bubu in his absence?
How does Bubu see himself?

In the long 21st century, Bubu may meet
some communist bunny from China.
Will Bubu return her accented greeting
with a perplexed smile,
or will they sniff and pass each other—
a fluffy moon at its perigee?

Yes, Bubu is born so American
he can easily run for president.
Thank God he hasn’t expressed a zeal
for proposing tax reforms
or deporting Russian spies.

Bubu munches orchard hay.
From behind I see a fierce typist at work.
The paper balls he throws away
hang in the sky as crumpled clouds.

Or is Bubu an underground radio operator,
who keeps sending the Morse code of wonder
(now his antennae ears are up)
to somewhere far, far away?

No matter which language Bubu the bunny
adopts to write his early oeuvre,
we will always love him, support him, and make sure
he doesn’t travel alone to Chengdu."
Claws of the Sea,Madeleine Wattenberg,
Dream of Low Houses,Max Schleicher,"I was there; and the river
was there everywhere;
in the glue
of dead leaves and dew stuck to its shores;
in the cracked cement sides;
in the old valley walls
widened by quarries that are gone now
and quarrymen that are gone now too;
in the roads;
in the snail tracks;
in the accumulations
of stringed earplugs; in curbside cigarettes
left from graveyard shifts;
in low houses with plastic
on front windows
to seal themselves from foundry dust;
in the explosion at Falk
Corporation that dented the fire station door
a mile and a half away;
in the fish
flat as butter knives that die gasping
after following big ships
from north on the Lake,
(dying
they are not used to the warmth
of the harbor);
in the coyote that limps in the quarry carveout
to sun himself on Christmas morning;
in the fox that eats the birds that die
frozen to the Lake in a snap; and in the light
that seems to change monthly
though I know it never
changes in that way.

I was there
with a friend
at the Protestant shelter
that gave us food for believing
we were not to blame for the state of our lives
and for accepting the state of  Lord  Jesus Christ
as we prayed and slept in a dormitory with 20
bunks full of men flatulent or masturbating
and I saw the invisible heart of  Jesus Christ
like a  jellyfish it stung me
like ticks I had it
in the seams of my jeans
like an arrowhead it dug into the flesh above
my ankle. And I told Jesus, listen, if you come by me
use the side door or the back, never the front,
the side or the back is for family."
The End of Crisis,Cindy Juyoung Ok,"When you leap over the deer carcasses
that line every garden, you will marvel
at their tidiness, at how bloodless a death
by drought can be. When I crawl through
the highway pieces shattered by heat,
I will admire the clean slits as I kick
aside crumbles of broken stone with little
blistering. When you thread between
the overtaken shores and bodies of elders,
frozen, when I follow the fallen saplings’
directions toward the horizon where
colorless sky and earth meet, we will
remember rippling at the birthday parties
for corporations and framing the ash
of beloved photos burnt in wildfire. When
we think of crossing the river to each
other, you from the gorge of the landslide
to me at the crest of the typhoon, it is then
we will find ourselves in a dead imaginary,
in some fictive past where the  you exists,
where I   is not a myth we use to keep
surviving at the cost of bird and glacier,
home and tenderness. Having ruined
the future of  becoming fossils, finally
we will know that it is for nothing we
die, never in place of drowned sea
turtles or swarming locusts, or to foil
cancerous sand and mold, not even for
the dance of subway floods or the graceless
eclipse of all our promises and planets."

Dicen que el nombre de Nuevo México fue declarado por primera vez el 12 de
julio del año 1598, en la confluencia de los ríos Bravo y Chama.
  
 
 Dicen que su declarante, Juan de Oñate y Salazar, esperaba encontrar otras
riquezas —las riquezas de otros— , superiores a las de los mexica al sur.
  
 
 Y un año después, sus soldados demandaron de los acoma los          
 
suministros necesarios para sobrevivir el invierno.                          
 
Y cuando resistieron porque acceder sería aceptar su propia             
 
muerte, Oñate decretó la matanza de 800 de los acoma, la             
 
esclavitud de los 500 mujeres y niños restantes y la amputación del  
 
pie derecho de los 80 hombres sobrevivientes.

Flyway,Romeo Oriogun,"There is no light that holds the dead
in beauty like the light before nightfall,
that evening abundance of grace
luring the wild geese to stop on their way
to Mexico, bringing all that is gone
into a moment of homecoming.
I had walked through it once.
It was December, the cold was beginning,
and here in Ames, Africans at the crossroad
of life, refugees and migrants, were getting
ready to meet at a makeshift bar assembled
in a basement and named after a famous donkey
in Khartoum, so they said, where the rhumba
would wild out of speakers and we would seek
what those at crossroads seek: touch and joy,
sight and the safety of bodies. I had taken
my time before getting on the bus heading
to the bar. Walking down Coconino,
the dogs were out, blades of grass faded,
man-made lakes were filled with geese like airports
on water. Even in the midst of so much beauty
there is no place that will save us. Our destination
is between suffering and joy, everything else is a road
filled with unending patience. And even I, a nomad,
who has witnessed so much of the world,
will be forgotten before I reach the veranda
of my homeland, and yet as I watched the last light
of evening, waiting for the bus, I saw them, the dead,
descending on wings, joining the birds to play
in water like little children, laughing into joy,
and then they were gone. All that was left
was the only freedom we could speak without shame,
the weather, winter, the harmony of all things."

Healing Will Come: Elegy after Natural Disaster,Patricia Jabbeh Wesley,"She searches the ruins like someone
who has wandered so far away.

Six children, I had six children,
she tells herself. All around, her world
has become twigs of splintered pieces
of a long-ago life,
not so long ago.

She lays down one child alongside another
child, alongside another,
but then, she stands there, wiping her
eyes, looking ahead, turning over

the ruins of pieces of a place that once
was, in the ruins of a life that once was.
But they were six children, she says,
six, dead, or alive.

A mother knows what it means
to have six, not three, but six living
children, not three only, dead,
and there, the tears, calming for now,
calming, for now.
Always.

What would I do without tears,
I used to ask myself in another world.
What would she do without tears,
I now ask myself, and now,
the water from her eyes, unlike
the water that has taken
everything away with it.

Somewhere, always, somewhere,
there’s a day when healing comes.
Wasn’t this what life was supposed to bring,
after death, the healing?
Healing refuses to be lost to death,
I say, healing will come."

all this without you suspecting me,

I want you. I had to use a  Japanese word, ginko, to explain

I was a series of footprints
pressed deep into the earth, covered in snow.

Red Meat: Fragments of Stesichoros,Anne Carson,"I. GERYON

Geryon was a monster everything about him was red
Put his snout out of the covers in the morning it was red
How stiff the red landscape where his cattle scraped against
Their hobbles in the red wind
Burrowed himself down in the red dawn jelly of Geryon's
Dream

Geryon's dream began red then slipped out of the vat and ran
Upsail broke silver shot up through his roots like a pup

Secret pup At the front end of another red day



II. MEANWHILE HE CAME

Across the salt knobs it was Him
Knew about the homegold
Had sighted red smoke above the red spires



III. GERYON'S PARENTS

If you persist in wearing your mask at the supper table
Well Goodnight Then they said and drove him up
Those hemorrhaging stairs to the hot dry Arms
To the ticking red taxi of the incubus
Don't want to go want to stay Downstairs and read



IV. GERYON'S DEATH BEGINS

Geryon walked the red length of his mind and answered No
It was murder And torn to see the cattle lay
All these darlings said Geryon And now me



V. GERYON'S REVERSIBLE DESTINY

His mother saw it mothers are like that
Trust me she said Engineer of his softness
You don't have to make up your mind right away
Behind her red right cheek Geryon could see
Coil of the hot plate starting to glow



VI. MEANWHILE IN HEAVEN

Athena was looking down through the floor
Of the glass-bottomed boat Athena pointed
Zeus looked Him



VII. GERYON'S WEEKEND

Later well later they left the bar went back to the centaur's
Place the centaur had a cup made out of a skull Holding three
Measures of wine Holding it he drank Come over here you can
Bring your drink if you're afraid to come alone The centaur
Patted the sofa beside him Reddish yellow small alive animal
Not a bee moved up Geryon's spine on the inside



VIII. GERYON'S FATHER

A quiet root may know how to holler He liked to
Suck words Here is an almighty one he would say
After days of standing in the doorway
NIGHTBOLLSNORTED



IX. GERYON'S WAR RECORD

Geryon lay on the ground covering his ears The sound
Of the horses like roses being burned alive



X. SCHOOLING

In those days the police were weak Family was strong
Hand in hand the first day Geryon'ş mother took him to
School She neatened his little red wings and pushed him
In through the door



XI. RIGHT

Are there many little boys who think they are a
Monster? But in my case I am right said Geryon to the
Dog they were sitting on the bluffs The dog regarded him
Joyfully



XII. WINGS

Steps off a scraped March sky and sinks
Up into the blind Atlantic morning One small
Red dog jumping across the beach miles below
Like a freed shadow



XIII. HERAKLES' KILLING CLUB

Little red dog did not see it he felt it All
Events carry but one



XIV. HERAKLE'S ARROW

Arrow means kill It parted Geryon's skull like a comb Made
The boy neck lean At an odd slow angle sideways as when a
Poppy shames itself in a whip of Nude breeze



XV. TOTAL THINGS KNOWN ABOUT GERYON

He loved lightning He lived on an island His mother was a
Nymph of a river that ran to the sea His father was a gold
Cutting tool Old scholia say that Stesichoros says that
Geryon had six hands and six feet and wings He was red and
His strange red cattle excited envy Herakles came and
Killed him for his cattle

the confluence of the Chama and the Rio Grande.
  
 
 They say that Juan de Oñate y Salazar, who declared it, hoped to find other
riches—others’ riches—greater than those of the Mexica to the south.
  
 
 And one year later, his soldiers demanded from the Acoma the supplies
 
necessary to survive the winter.                                                 
 
And when they resisted because ceding to the demand would mean      
 
accepting their own death, Oñate decreed the murder of 800 of the      
 
Acoma, the enslavement of the remaining 500 women and children,      
 
and the amputation of the right foot of the 80 surviving men.                 
  
 
 They say that the wounded antelope will keep walking until it collapses in
the sand.
  
 
 And in 1997 in the city of Alcalde, the Friends of Acoma amputated        
 
Oñate’s bronze foot, still adorned with spur and stirrup.










They say that the name Arizona comes from the O’odham language:
from the word alĭ ṣonak, which means “small spring.”

And almost half of the remains scattered across the immense
barrier of the desert are found in the territory of the Tohono
O’odham Nation.

They say that it originally referred to the Bolas de Plata region, brief pride
of the Spaniards during the first half of the eighteenth century, today a few
kilometers south of the border.

And the majority of their deaths are caused by exposure to
the elements, exhaustion, and lack of drinkable water.

They say that it’s an official strategy to push migrants into the most
unforgiving territories.

And agents are taught to trample the caches of water stashed
there by volunteers.

Black Woman Selling Her Home in America,Patricia Jabbeh Wesley,"After the show, I can reenter my home
and take myself  back.
From room to room, I examine my home
to see if the possible buyers
did not take a piece of shredded
carpet with them, did not pull down a window blind,
and yes, the television is still standing.

But through the box walls, I feel their fingernails
rising out of the corners of my rooms,
their presence, these strangers, these spies,
these unknown people who have walked
through my home,
have touched my private places in my home,
done this abominable thing of touring

my bedroom, my sleeping place, where at night
I revisit my ancestors
over and over. My bedroom, where I can steal
away at night and meet
my mother in the other world.
In my country, you do not sell your home.
You do not sell your home to strangers.

You do not move away so others can possess
your possessions. You plant feet
and umbilical cords deep. I have been
selling my home for a year now.
I have been selling myself for years now,
and my possible buyers do not seem to see
the house they cannot see.

Sometimes I wish my home was not as black
as me, that the skin
of my aluminum sidings were not gray
or black like me. After the show,
I come back home, walking like a broken
woman. I walk in fearfully,
letting myself into my own home

in small particles of dust. I walk in like
you walk into a haunted house,
holding onto foot and arm. Sometimes, I can
see their large eyes, these buyers, who
walk in with ugly coats, who come in,
their prying eyes, afraid something may spring
at them when they finally move into my home."
Bodhisattvas at the Beach in November,Monica Sok,"You can bring half that Gouda in your fridge if you want.

I’ll bring a persimmon, my cutting board, and knife.

What about this olive bread—Oh yes, get this olive bread. Cash only.
Do you have cash? All right, fine. I have cash.

On 580 toward San Francisco, we talk about the imbecile men
who have rejected us lately.

Sister, sex is nothing to be embarrassed about.

Sister, the more  you tell me about him the less I like him.

Hold my hand as we descend this hill of sand and hidden rocks.

Bodhisattvas at the beach are each other’s bitches but not everybody’s,
though we vow to return many lifetimes
until not one being is suffering, not even one blade of grass.

Let’s lay the mat somewhere—you pick a spot—and drink margaritas.

You change from hiking boots into sandals and bare feet.
I still have on my socks. Bitches don’t get cold.

1 sliced apple, 4 dates, 2 mandarins, a few square coconut crackers—
the kind that comes stale,
the kind my mom buys and leaves in my cupboard.

I  feel really bad for your mom. I mean ... I  feel really bad for my mom too!

A white dog walks up to us. A black dog sits next to our shoes.
They go when their owners call them back.

Next time I want a basket to bring to the beach. What kind of basket?
A wicker basket with a lid.

Oh and a separate basket for the wine bottle and wine glasses.
I want a basket for fruit. I want that too.

You and I with separate lighters burn incense sticks,
our bodies huddling over the flames
to keep them going against November wind.

I’m done praying before you’re done praying.

Bitch, I’m envious that you’re still praying.

As you chant to yourself quietly, as the scent of sandalwood snakes toward us,
I lie down watching two tiny crustaceans from wet sand
skip onto the mat.

What is your purpose? Do you mean my purpose in life ? I’m a bodhisattva.
I am too. I know.

I’m not here to change anybody. Or tell anybody what’s best for them.

I know why the sun is out today. Because yesterday it rained.

Are you sure you want to wear boots? Instead of your sandals?
I’m rolling up my pants to walk to the water.
Whatever we try to prevent from happening, will happen.

The tide rushes toward us. It knows we are here.

Now my pants are wet up to my calves
and your boots are completely soaked,
but the chrysanthemums are floating in the ocean.

Our small offering.

I love you. I love you too.

Let me put on my socks and sneakers to climb the steep hill with you,
huffing and puffing, and not without laughter.

I’m getting better at accepting myself and others and the way things are.

Look at the sunset beyond the pink ice plants. Yes, I see.

Look at this spray-painted bench high off the ground. It has character.
If you say so. Character.

The air smells like basil. Or mint. I told you this in the beginning
when we first got here. It’s eucalyptus.

I can’t remember the last time I held someone’s hand. Bitch, it was me.
In January. Before lockdown.

It seemed like a lifetime ago. It was many lifetimes ago."
Bubu the Bunny,Qiang Meng,"My girlfriend adopts a rabbit,
and we name him Bubu Dostoevsky Luo.
Luo is my girlfriend’s last name.
Luo bu means radish in Chinese.
Dostoevsky is a writer I like.

Bubu never writes in the first month,
although his modest nose twitching
implies a burning interest in language.

My girlfriend and I speak Chinese at home
but feel obliged to rethink this practice
like every immigrant household:

She points out that Bubu
is an American bunny,
and he needs to fit into society.

Poor Bubu. Will he grow up ignorant of the story
behind the Mooncake Festival,
meaning of his own name,
locations of Beijing and Shanghai—
which one is farther north?
And Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu
where people cook (Bubu should be aware!)
spicy marinated rabbit heads.

Do we take Bubu to church on Sunday?
Wedding ceremony sans fresh longans,
grave adorned with a cute wood cross?

Other bunnies carrying Easter egg baskets
may ask Bubu to talk about his family.
What will they call Bubu in his absence?
How does Bubu see himself?

In the long 21st century, Bubu may meet
some communist bunny from China.
Will Bubu return her accented greeting
with a perplexed smile,
or will they sniff and pass each other—
a fluffy moon at its perigee?

Yes, Bubu is born so American
he can easily run for president.
Thank God he hasn’t expressed a zeal
for proposing tax reforms
or deporting Russian spies.

Bubu munches orchard hay.
From behind I see a fierce typist at work.
The paper balls he throws away
hang in the sky as crumpled clouds.

Or is Bubu an underground radio operator,
who keeps sending the Morse code of wonder
(now his antennae ears are up)
to somewhere far, far away?

No matter which language Bubu the bunny
adopts to write his early oeuvre,
we will always love him, support him, and make sure
he doesn’t travel alone to Chengdu."
Claws of the Sea,Madeleine Wattenberg,
Dream of Low Houses,Max Schleicher,"I was there; and the river
was there everywhere;
in the glue
of dead leaves and dew stuck to its shores;
in the cracked cement sides;
in the old valley walls
widened by quarries that are gone now
and quarrymen that are gone now too;
in the roads;
in the snail tracks;
in the accumulations
of stringed earplugs; in curbside cigarettes
left from graveyard shifts;
in low houses with plastic
on front windows
to seal themselves from foundry dust;
in the explosion at Falk
Corporation that dented the fire station door
a mile and a half away;
in the fish
flat as butter knives that die gasping
after following big ships
from north on the Lake,
(dying
they are not used to the warmth
of the harbor);
in the coyote that limps in the quarry carveout
to sun himself on Christmas morning;
in the fox that eats the birds that die
frozen to the Lake in a snap; and in the light
that seems to change monthly
though I know it never
changes in that way.

I was there
with a friend
at the Protestant shelter
that gave us food for believing
we were not to blame for the state of our lives
and for accepting the state of  Lord  Jesus Christ
as we prayed and slept in a dormitory with 20
bunks full of men flatulent or masturbating
and I saw the invisible heart of  Jesus Christ
like a  jellyfish it stung me
like ticks I had it
in the seams of my jeans
like an arrowhead it dug into the flesh above
my ankle. And I told Jesus, listen, if you come by me
use the side door or the back, never the front,
the side or the back is for family."
The End of Crisis,Cindy Juyoung Ok,"When you leap over the deer carcasses
that line every garden, you will marvel
at their tidiness, at how bloodless a death
by drought can be. When I crawl through
the highway pieces shattered by heat,
I will admire the clean slits as I kick
aside crumbles of broken stone with little
blistering. When you thread between
the overtaken shores and bodies of elders,
frozen, when I follow the fallen saplings’
directions toward the horizon where
colorless sky and earth meet, we will
remember rippling at the birthday parties
for corporations and framing the ash
of beloved photos burnt in wildfire. When
we think of crossing the river to each
other, you from the gorge of the landslide
to me at the crest of the typhoon, it is then
we will find ourselves in a dead imaginary,
in some fictive past where the  you exists,
where I   is not a myth we use to keep
surviving at the cost of bird and glacier,
home and tenderness. Having ruined
the future of  becoming fossils, finally
we will know that it is for nothing we
die, never in place of drowned sea
turtles or swarming locusts, or to foil
cancerous sand and mold, not even for
the dance of subway floods or the graceless
eclipse of all our promises and planets."

Flyway,Romeo Oriogun,"There is no light that holds the dead
in beauty like the light before nightfall,
that evening abundance of grace
luring the wild geese to stop on their way
to Mexico, bringing all that is gone
into a moment of homecoming.
I had walked through it once.
It was December, the cold was beginning,
and here in Ames, Africans at the crossroad
of life, refugees and migrants, were getting
ready to meet at a makeshift bar assembled
in a basement and named after a famous donkey
in Khartoum, so they said, where the rhumba
would wild out of speakers and we would seek
what those at crossroads seek: touch and joy,
sight and the safety of bodies. I had taken
my time before getting on the bus heading
to the bar. Walking down Coconino,
the dogs were out, blades of grass faded,
man-made lakes were filled with geese like airports
on water. Even in the midst of so much beauty
there is no place that will save us. Our destination
is between suffering and joy, everything else is a road
filled with unending patience. And even I, a nomad,
who has witnessed so much of the world,
will be forgotten before I reach the veranda
of my homeland, and yet as I watched the last light
of evening, waiting for the bus, I saw them, the dead,
descending on wings, joining the birds to play
in water like little children, laughing into joy,
and then they were gone. All that was left
was the only freedom we could speak without shame,
the weather, winter, the harmony of all things."

Healing Will Come: Elegy after Natural Disaster,Patricia Jabbeh Wesley,"She searches the ruins like someone
who has wandered so far away.

Six children, I had six children,
she tells herself. All around, her world
has become twigs of splintered pieces
of a long-ago life,
not so long ago.

She lays down one child alongside another
child, alongside another,
but then, she stands there, wiping her
eyes, looking ahead, turning over

the ruins of pieces of a place that once
was, in the ruins of a life that once was.
But they were six children, she says,
six, dead, or alive.

A mother knows what it means
to have six, not three, but six living
children, not three only, dead,
and there, the tears, calming for now,
calming, for now.
Always.

What would I do without tears,
I used to ask myself in another world.
What would she do without tears,
I now ask myself, and now,
the water from her eyes, unlike
the water that has taken
everything away with it.

Somewhere, always, somewhere,
there’s a day when healing comes.
Wasn’t this what life was supposed to bring,
after death, the healing?
Healing refuses to be lost to death,
I say, healing will come."

I want you. I had to use a  Japanese word, ginko, to explain

I was a series of footprints
pressed deep into the earth, covered in snow.

Red Meat: Fragments of Stesichoros,Anne Carson,"I. GERYON

Geryon was a monster everything about him was red
Put his snout out of the covers in the morning it was red
How stiff the red landscape where his cattle scraped against
Their hobbles in the red wind
Burrowed himself down in the red dawn jelly of Geryon's
Dream

Geryon's dream began red then slipped out of the vat and ran
Upsail broke silver shot up through his roots like a pup

Secret pup At the front end of another red day



II. MEANWHILE HE CAME

Across the salt knobs it was Him
Knew about the homegold
Had sighted red smoke above the red spires



III. GERYON'S PARENTS

If you persist in wearing your mask at the supper table
Well Goodnight Then they said and drove him up
Those hemorrhaging stairs to the hot dry Arms
To the ticking red taxi of the incubus
Don't want to go want to stay Downstairs and read



IV. GERYON'S DEATH BEGINS

Geryon walked the red length of his mind and answered No
It was murder And torn to see the cattle lay
All these darlings said Geryon And now me



V. GERYON'S REVERSIBLE DESTINY

His mother saw it mothers are like that
Trust me she said Engineer of his softness
You don't have to make up your mind right away
Behind her red right cheek Geryon could see
Coil of the hot plate starting to glow



VI. MEANWHILE IN HEAVEN

Athena was looking down through the floor
Of the glass-bottomed boat Athena pointed
Zeus looked Him



VII. GERYON'S WEEKEND

Later well later they left the bar went back to the centaur's
Place the centaur had a cup made out of a skull Holding three
Measures of wine Holding it he drank Come over here you can
Bring your drink if you're afraid to come alone The centaur
Patted the sofa beside him Reddish yellow small alive animal
Not a bee moved up Geryon's spine on the inside



VIII. GERYON'S FATHER

A quiet root may know how to holler He liked to
Suck words Here is an almighty one he would say
After days of standing in the doorway
NIGHTBOLLSNORTED



IX. GERYON'S WAR RECORD

Geryon lay on the ground covering his ears The sound
Of the horses like roses being burned alive



X. SCHOOLING

In those days the police were weak Family was strong
Hand in hand the first day Geryon'ş mother took him to
School She neatened his little red wings and pushed him
In through the door



XI. RIGHT

Are there many little boys who think they are a
Monster? But in my case I am right said Geryon to the
Dog they were sitting on the bluffs The dog regarded him
Joyfully



XII. WINGS

Steps off a scraped March sky and sinks
Up into the blind Atlantic morning One small
Red dog jumping across the beach miles below
Like a freed shadow



XIII. HERAKLES' KILLING CLUB

Little red dog did not see it he felt it All
Events carry but one



XIV. HERAKLE'S ARROW

Arrow means kill It parted Geryon's skull like a comb Made
The boy neck lean At an odd slow angle sideways as when a
Poppy shames itself in a whip of Nude breeze



XV. TOTAL THINGS KNOWN ABOUT GERYON

He loved lightning He lived on an island His mother was a
Nymph of a river that ran to the sea His father was a gold
Cutting tool Old scholia say that Stesichoros says that
Geryon had six hands and six feet and wings He was red and
His strange red cattle excited envy Herakles came and
Killed him for his cattle

The dog too

 They say that Juan de Oñate y Salazar, who declared it, hoped to find other
riches—others’ riches—greater than those of the Mexica to the south.
  
 
 And one year later, his soldiers demanded from the Acoma the supplies
 
necessary to survive the winter.                                                 
 
And when they resisted because ceding to the demand would mean      
 
accepting their own death, Oñate decreed the murder of 800 of the      
 
Acoma, the enslavement of the remaining 500 women and children,      
 
and the amputation of the right foot of the 80 surviving men.

kilometers south of the border.

And the majority of their deaths are caused by exposure to
the elements, exhaustion, and lack of drinkable water.

unforgiving territories.

And agents are taught to trample the caches of water stashed

Black Woman Selling Her Home in America,Patricia Jabbeh Wesley,"After the show, I can reenter my home
and take myself  back.
From room to room, I examine my home
to see if the possible buyers
did not take a piece of shredded
carpet with them, did not pull down a window blind,
and yes, the television is still standing.

But through the box walls, I feel their fingernails
rising out of the corners of my rooms,
their presence, these strangers, these spies,
these unknown people who have walked
through my home,
have touched my private places in my home,
done this abominable thing of touring

my bedroom, my sleeping place, where at night
I revisit my ancestors
over and over. My bedroom, where I can steal
away at night and meet
my mother in the other world.
In my country, you do not sell your home.
You do not sell your home to strangers.

You do not move away so others can possess
your possessions. You plant feet
and umbilical cords deep. I have been
selling my home for a year now.
I have been selling myself for years now,
and my possible buyers do not seem to see
the house they cannot see.

Sometimes I wish my home was not as black
as me, that the skin
of my aluminum sidings were not gray
or black like me. After the show,
I come back home, walking like a broken
woman. I walk in fearfully,
letting myself into my own home

in small particles of dust. I walk in like
you walk into a haunted house,
holding onto foot and arm. Sometimes, I can
see their large eyes, these buyers, who
walk in with ugly coats, who come in,
their prying eyes, afraid something may spring
at them when they finally move into my home."
Bodhisattvas at the Beach in November,Monica Sok,"You can bring half that Gouda in your fridge if you want.

You change from hiking boots into sandals and bare feet.
I still have on my socks. Bitches don’t get cold.

1 sliced apple, 4 dates, 2 mandarins, a few square coconut crackers—

the kind my mom buys and leaves in my cupboard.

skip onto the mat.

What is your purpose? Do you mean my purpose in life ? I’m a bodhisattva.
I am too. I know.

I’m not here to change anybody. Or tell anybody what’s best for them.

I know why the sun is out today. Because yesterday it rained.

Are you sure you want to wear boots? Instead of your sandals?
I’m rolling up my pants to walk to the water.
Whatever we try to prevent from happening, will happen.

The tide rushes toward us. It knows we are here.

Now my pants are wet up to my calves
and your boots are completely soaked,
but the chrysanthemums are floating in the ocean.

Our small offering.

I love you. I love you too.

Let me put on my socks and sneakers to climb the steep hill with you,
huffing and puffing, and not without laughter.

I’m getting better at accepting myself and others and the way things are.

Look at the sunset beyond the pink ice plants. Yes, I see.

Look at this spray-painted bench high off the ground. It has character.
If you say so. Character.

The air smells like basil. Or mint. I told you this in the beginning
when we first got here. It’s eucalyptus.

I can’t remember the last time I held someone’s hand. Bitch, it was me.
In January. Before lockdown.

It seemed like a lifetime ago. It was many lifetimes ago."
Bubu the Bunny,Qiang Meng,"My girlfriend adopts a rabbit,
and we name him Bubu Dostoevsky Luo.
Luo is my girlfriend’s last name.
Luo bu means radish in Chinese.
Dostoevsky is a writer I like.

Bubu never writes in the first month,
although his modest nose twitching
implies a burning interest in language.

My girlfriend and I speak Chinese at home
but feel obliged to rethink this practice
like every immigrant household:

She points out that Bubu
is an American bunny,
and he needs to fit into society.

Poor Bubu. Will he grow up ignorant of the story
behind the Mooncake Festival,
meaning of his own name,
locations of Beijing and Shanghai—
which one is farther north?
And Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu
where people cook (Bubu should be aware!)
spicy marinated rabbit heads.

Do we take Bubu to church on Sunday?
Wedding ceremony sans fresh longans,
grave adorned with a cute wood cross?

Other bunnies carrying Easter egg baskets
may ask Bubu to talk about his family.
What will they call Bubu in his absence?
How does Bubu see himself?

In the long 21st century, Bubu may meet
some communist bunny from China.
Will Bubu return her accented greeting
with a perplexed smile,
or will they sniff and pass each other—
a fluffy moon at its perigee?

Yes, Bubu is born so American
he can easily run for president.
Thank God he hasn’t expressed a zeal
for proposing tax reforms
or deporting Russian spies.

Bubu munches orchard hay.
From behind I see a fierce typist at work.
The paper balls he throws away
hang in the sky as crumpled clouds.

Or is Bubu an underground radio operator,
who keeps sending the Morse code of wonder
(now his antennae ears are up)
to somewhere far, far away?

No matter which language Bubu the bunny
adopts to write his early oeuvre,
we will always love him, support him, and make sure
he doesn’t travel alone to Chengdu."
Claws of the Sea,Madeleine Wattenberg,
Dream of Low Houses,Max Schleicher,"I was there; and the river
was there everywhere;
in the glue
of dead leaves and dew stuck to its shores;
in the cracked cement sides;
in the old valley walls
widened by quarries that are gone now
and quarrymen that are gone now too;
in the roads;
in the snail tracks;
in the accumulations
of stringed earplugs; in curbside cigarettes
left from graveyard shifts;
in low houses with plastic
on front windows
to seal themselves from foundry dust;
in the explosion at Falk
Corporation that dented the fire station door
a mile and a half away;
in the fish
flat as butter knives that die gasping
after following big ships
from north on the Lake,
(dying
they are not used to the warmth
of the harbor);
in the coyote that limps in the quarry carveout
to sun himself on Christmas morning;
in the fox that eats the birds that die
frozen to the Lake in a snap; and in the light
that seems to change monthly
though I know it never
changes in that way.

I was there
with a friend
at the Protestant shelter
that gave us food for believing
we were not to blame for the state of our lives
and for accepting the state of  Lord  Jesus Christ
as we prayed and slept in a dormitory with 20
bunks full of men flatulent or masturbating
and I saw the invisible heart of  Jesus Christ
like a  jellyfish it stung me
like ticks I had it
in the seams of my jeans
like an arrowhead it dug into the flesh above
my ankle. And I told Jesus, listen, if you come by me
use the side door or the back, never the front,
the side or the back is for family."
The End of Crisis,Cindy Juyoung Ok,"When you leap over the deer carcasses
that line every garden, you will marvel
at their tidiness, at how bloodless a death
by drought can be. When I crawl through
the highway pieces shattered by heat,
I will admire the clean slits as I kick
aside crumbles of broken stone with little
blistering. When you thread between
the overtaken shores and bodies of elders,
frozen, when I follow the fallen saplings’
directions toward the horizon where
colorless sky and earth meet, we will
remember rippling at the birthday parties
for corporations and framing the ash
of beloved photos burnt in wildfire. When
we think of crossing the river to each
other, you from the gorge of the landslide
to me at the crest of the typhoon, it is then
we will find ourselves in a dead imaginary,
in some fictive past where the  you exists,
where I   is not a myth we use to keep
surviving at the cost of bird and glacier,
home and tenderness. Having ruined
the future of  becoming fossils, finally
we will know that it is for nothing we
die, never in place of drowned sea
turtles or swarming locusts, or to foil
cancerous sand and mold, not even for
the dance of subway floods or the graceless
eclipse of all our promises and planets."

Flyway,Romeo Oriogun,"There is no light that holds the dead
in beauty like the light before nightfall,
that evening abundance of grace
luring the wild geese to stop on their way
to Mexico, bringing all that is gone
into a moment of homecoming.
I had walked through it once.
It was December, the cold was beginning,
and here in Ames, Africans at the crossroad
of life, refugees and migrants, were getting
ready to meet at a makeshift bar assembled
in a basement and named after a famous donkey
in Khartoum, so they said, where the rhumba
would wild out of speakers and we would seek
what those at crossroads seek: touch and joy,
sight and the safety of bodies. I had taken
my time before getting on the bus heading
to the bar. Walking down Coconino,
the dogs were out, blades of grass faded,
man-made lakes were filled with geese like airports
on water. Even in the midst of so much beauty
there is no place that will save us. Our destination
is between suffering and joy, everything else is a road
filled with unending patience. And even I, a nomad,
who has witnessed so much of the world,
will be forgotten before I reach the veranda
of my homeland, and yet as I watched the last light
of evening, waiting for the bus, I saw them, the dead,
descending on wings, joining the birds to play
in water like little children, laughing into joy,
and then they were gone. All that was left
was the only freedom we could speak without shame,
the weather, winter, the harmony of all things."

Healing Will Come: Elegy after Natural Disaster,Patricia Jabbeh Wesley,"She searches the ruins like someone
who has wandered so far away.

Six children, I had six children,
she tells herself. All around, her world
has become twigs of splintered pieces
of a long-ago life,
not so long ago.

She lays down one child alongside another
child, alongside another,
but then, she stands there, wiping her
eyes, looking ahead, turning over

the ruins of pieces of a place that once
was, in the ruins of a life that once was.
But they were six children, she says,
six, dead, or alive.

A mother knows what it means
to have six, not three, but six living
children, not three only, dead,
and there, the tears, calming for now,
calming, for now.
Always.

What would I do without tears,
I used to ask myself in another world.
What would she do without tears,
I now ask myself, and now,
the water from her eyes, unlike
the water that has taken
everything away with it.

Somewhere, always, somewhere,
there’s a day when healing comes.
Wasn’t this what life was supposed to bring,
after death, the healing?
Healing refuses to be lost to death,
I say, healing will come."

it wasn’t my mother whom I’d spoken about—
all this without you suspecting me,

I’d like to think. I’ve whispered Te quiero to actually mean
I want you. I had to use a  Japanese word, ginko, to explain
in English my first time seeing the splitting yellow
fans of eun-haeng leaves in Korea.

There’s so much of the past in these

how I wished for a long, unfractured life:
I slurped noodles, threaded
needles. But again and again I dreamt
I was a series of footprints
pressed deep into the earth, covered in snow.

Red Meat: Fragments of Stesichoros,Anne Carson,"I. GERYON

Geryon was a monster everything about him was red
Put his snout out of the covers in the morning it was red
How stiff the red landscape where his cattle scraped against
Their hobbles in the red wind
Burrowed himself down in the red dawn jelly of Geryon's
Dream

Geryon's dream began red then slipped out of the vat and ran
Upsail broke silver shot up through his roots like a pup

Secret pup At the front end of another red day



II. MEANWHILE HE CAME

Across the salt knobs it was Him
Knew about the homegold
Had sighted red smoke above the red spires



III. GERYON'S PARENTS

If you persist in wearing your mask at the supper table
Well Goodnight Then they said and drove him up
Those hemorrhaging stairs to the hot dry Arms
To the ticking red taxi of the incubus
Don't want to go want to stay Downstairs and read



IV. GERYON'S DEATH BEGINS

Geryon walked the red length of his mind and answered No
It was murder And torn to see the cattle lay
All these darlings said Geryon And now me



V. GERYON'S REVERSIBLE DESTINY

His mother saw it mothers are like that
Trust me she said Engineer of his softness
You don't have to make up your mind right away
Behind her red right cheek Geryon could see
Coil of the hot plate starting to glow



VI. MEANWHILE IN HEAVEN

Athena was looking down through the floor
Of the glass-bottomed boat Athena pointed
Zeus looked Him



VII. GERYON'S WEEKEND

Later well later they left the bar went back to the centaur's
Place the centaur had a cup made out of a skull Holding three
Measures of wine Holding it he drank Come over here you can
Bring your drink if you're afraid to come alone The centaur
Patted the sofa beside him Reddish yellow small alive animal
Not a bee moved up Geryon's spine on the inside



VIII. GERYON'S FATHER

A quiet root may know how to holler He liked to
Suck words Here is an almighty one he would say
After days of standing in the doorway
NIGHTBOLLSNORTED



IX. GERYON'S WAR RECORD

Geryon lay on the ground covering his ears The sound
Of the horses like roses being burned alive



X. SCHOOLING

In those days the police were weak Family was strong
Hand in hand the first day Geryon'ş mother took him to
School She neatened his little red wings and pushed him
In through the door



XI. RIGHT

Are there many little boys who think they are a
Monster? But in my case I am right said Geryon to the
Dog they were sitting on the bluffs The dog regarded him
Joyfully



XII. WINGS

Steps off a scraped March sky and sinks
Up into the blind Atlantic morning One small
Red dog jumping across the beach miles below
Like a freed shadow



XIII. HERAKLES' KILLING CLUB

Little red dog did not see it he felt it All
Events carry but one



XIV. HERAKLE'S ARROW

Arrow means kill It parted Geryon's skull like a comb Made
The boy neck lean At an odd slow angle sideways as when a
Poppy shames itself in a whip of Nude breeze



XV. TOTAL THINGS KNOWN ABOUT GERYON

He loved lightning He lived on an island His mother was a
Nymph of a river that ran to the sea His father was a gold
Cutting tool Old scholia say that Stesichoros says that
Geryon had six hands and six feet and wings He was red and
His strange red cattle excited envy Herakles came and
Killed him for his cattle

 They say that Juan de Oñate y Salazar, who declared it, hoped to find other
riches—others’ riches—greater than those of the Mexica to the south.
  
 
 And one year later, his soldiers demanded from the Acoma the supplies
 
necessary to survive the winter.                                                 
 
And when they resisted because ceding to the demand would mean

Acoma, the enslavement of the remaining 500 women and children,      
 
and the amputation of the right foot of the 80 surviving men.

And the majority of their deaths are caused by exposure to

their presence, these strangers, these spies,
these unknown people who have walked
through my home,
have touched my private places in my home,
done this abominable thing of touring

my bedroom, my sleeping place, where at night
I revisit my ancestors
over and over. My bedroom, where I can steal
away at night and meet
my mother in the other world.
In my country, you do not sell your home.
You do not sell your home to strangers.

You do not move away so others can possess
your possessions. You plant feet
and umbilical cords deep. I have been
selling my home for a year now.
I have been selling myself for years now,
and my possible buyers do not seem to see
the house they cannot see.

Sometimes I wish my home was not as black
as me, that the skin
of my aluminum sidings were not gray
or black like me. After the show,
I come back home, walking like a broken
woman. I walk in fearfully,
letting myself into my own home

in small particles of dust. I walk in like
you walk into a haunted house,
holding onto foot and arm. Sometimes, I can
see their large eyes, these buyers, who
walk in with ugly coats, who come in,
their prying eyes, afraid something may spring
at them when they finally move into my home."
Bodhisattvas at the Beach in November,Monica Sok,"You can bring half that Gouda in your fridge if you want.

I’ll bring a persimmon, my cutting board, and knife.

But first golden chrysanthemums at the farmers market, cut at the stem
and wrapped in butcher paper.

What about this olive bread—Oh yes, get this olive bread. Cash only.
Do you have cash? All right, fine. I have cash.

On 580 toward San Francisco, we talk about the imbecile men
who have rejected us lately.

Sister, sex is nothing to be embarrassed about.

Sister, the more  you tell me about him the less I like him.

Hold my hand as we descend this hill of sand and hidden rocks.

Bodhisattvas at the beach are each other’s bitches but not everybody’s,
though we vow to return many lifetimes
until not one being is suffering, not even one blade of grass.

Let’s lay the mat somewhere—you pick a spot—and drink margaritas.

You change from hiking boots into sandals and bare feet.
I still have on my socks. Bitches don’t get cold.

1 sliced apple, 4 dates, 2 mandarins, a few square coconut crackers—
the kind that comes stale,
the kind my mom buys and leaves in my cupboard.

I  feel really bad for your mom. I mean ... I  feel really bad for my mom too!

A white dog walks up to us. A black dog sits next to our shoes.
They go when their owners call them back.

Next time I want a basket to bring to the beach. What kind of basket?
A wicker basket with a lid.

Oh and a separate basket for the wine bottle and wine glasses.
I want a basket for fruit. I want that too.

You and I with separate lighters burn incense sticks,
our bodies huddling over the flames
to keep them going against November wind.

I’m done praying before you’re done praying.

Bitch, I’m envious that you’re still praying.

As you chant to yourself quietly, as the scent of sandalwood snakes toward us,
I lie down watching two tiny crustaceans from wet sand
skip onto the mat.

What is your purpose? Do you mean my purpose in life ? I’m a bodhisattva.
I am too. I know.

I’m not here to change anybody. Or tell anybody what’s best for them.

I know why the sun is out today. Because yesterday it rained.

Are you sure you want to wear boots? Instead of your sandals?
I’m rolling up my pants to walk to the water.
Whatever we try to prevent from happening, will happen.

The tide rushes toward us. It knows we are here.

Now my pants are wet up to my calves
and your boots are completely soaked,
but the chrysanthemums are floating in the ocean.

Our small offering.

I love you. I love you too.

Let me put on my socks and sneakers to climb the steep hill with you,
huffing and puffing, and not without laughter.

I’m getting better at accepting myself and others and the way things are.

Look at the sunset beyond the pink ice plants. Yes, I see.

Look at this spray-painted bench high off the ground. It has character.
If you say so. Character.

The air smells like basil. Or mint. I told you this in the beginning
when we first got here. It’s eucalyptus.

I can’t remember the last time I held someone’s hand. Bitch, it was me.
In January. Before lockdown.

It seemed like a lifetime ago. It was many lifetimes ago."
Bubu the Bunny,Qiang Meng,"My girlfriend adopts a rabbit,
and we name him Bubu Dostoevsky Luo.
Luo is my girlfriend’s last name.
Luo bu means radish in Chinese.
Dostoevsky is a writer I like.

Bubu never writes in the first month,
although his modest nose twitching
implies a burning interest in language.

My girlfriend and I speak Chinese at home
but feel obliged to rethink this practice
like every immigrant household:

She points out that Bubu
is an American bunny,
and he needs to fit into society.

Poor Bubu. Will he grow up ignorant of the story
behind the Mooncake Festival,
meaning of his own name,
locations of Beijing and Shanghai—
which one is farther north?
And Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu
where people cook (Bubu should be aware!)
spicy marinated rabbit heads.

Do we take Bubu to church on Sunday?
Wedding ceremony sans fresh longans,
grave adorned with a cute wood cross?

Other bunnies carrying Easter egg baskets
may ask Bubu to talk about his family.
What will they call Bubu in his absence?
How does Bubu see himself?

In the long 21st century, Bubu may meet
some communist bunny from China.
Will Bubu return her accented greeting
with a perplexed smile,
or will they sniff and pass each other—
a fluffy moon at its perigee?

Yes, Bubu is born so American
he can easily run for president.
Thank God he hasn’t expressed a zeal
for proposing tax reforms
or deporting Russian spies.

Bubu munches orchard hay.
From behind I see a fierce typist at work.
The paper balls he throws away
hang in the sky as crumpled clouds.

Or is Bubu an underground radio operator,
who keeps sending the Morse code of wonder
(now his antennae ears are up)
to somewhere far, far away?

No matter which language Bubu the bunny
adopts to write his early oeuvre,
we will always love him, support him, and make sure
he doesn’t travel alone to Chengdu."
Claws of the Sea,Madeleine Wattenberg,
Dream of Low Houses,Max Schleicher,"I was there; and the river
was there everywhere;
in the glue
of dead leaves and dew stuck to its shores;
in the cracked cement sides;
in the old valley walls
widened by quarries that are gone now
and quarrymen that are gone now too;
in the roads;
in the snail tracks;
in the accumulations
of stringed earplugs; in curbside cigarettes
left from graveyard shifts;
in low houses with plastic
on front windows
to seal themselves from foundry dust;
in the explosion at Falk
Corporation that dented the fire station door
a mile and a half away;
in the fish
flat as butter knives that die gasping
after following big ships
from north on the Lake,
(dying
they are not used to the warmth
of the harbor);
in the coyote that limps in the quarry carveout
to sun himself on Christmas morning;
in the fox that eats the birds that die
frozen to the Lake in a snap; and in the light
that seems to change monthly
though I know it never
changes in that way.

I was there
with a friend
at the Protestant shelter
that gave us food for believing
we were not to blame for the state of our lives
and for accepting the state of  Lord  Jesus Christ
as we prayed and slept in a dormitory with 20
bunks full of men flatulent or masturbating
and I saw the invisible heart of  Jesus Christ
like a  jellyfish it stung me
like ticks I had it
in the seams of my jeans
like an arrowhead it dug into the flesh above
my ankle. And I told Jesus, listen, if you come by me
use the side door or the back, never the front,
the side or the back is for family."
The End of Crisis,Cindy Juyoung Ok,"When you leap over the deer carcasses
that line every garden, you will marvel
at their tidiness, at how bloodless a death
by drought can be. When I crawl through
the highway pieces shattered by heat,
I will admire the clean slits as I kick
aside crumbles of broken stone with little
blistering. When you thread between
the overtaken shores and bodies of elders,
frozen, when I follow the fallen saplings’
directions toward the horizon where
colorless sky and earth meet, we will
remember rippling at the birthday parties
for corporations and framing the ash
of beloved photos burnt in wildfire. When
we think of crossing the river to each
other, you from the gorge of the landslide
to me at the crest of the typhoon, it is then
we will find ourselves in a dead imaginary,
in some fictive past where the  you exists,
where I   is not a myth we use to keep
surviving at the cost of bird and glacier,
home and tenderness. Having ruined
the future of  becoming fossils, finally
we will know that it is for nothing we
die, never in place of drowned sea
turtles or swarming locusts, or to foil
cancerous sand and mold, not even for
the dance of subway floods or the graceless
eclipse of all our promises and planets."

Flyway,Romeo Oriogun,"There is no light that holds the dead
in beauty like the light before nightfall,
that evening abundance of grace
luring the wild geese to stop on their way
to Mexico, bringing all that is gone
into a moment of homecoming.
I had walked through it once.
It was December, the cold was beginning,
and here in Ames, Africans at the crossroad
of life, refugees and migrants, were getting
ready to meet at a makeshift bar assembled
in a basement and named after a famous donkey
in Khartoum, so they said, where the rhumba
would wild out of speakers and we would seek
what those at crossroads seek: touch and joy,
sight and the safety of bodies. I had taken
my time before getting on the bus heading
to the bar. Walking down Coconino,
the dogs were out, blades of grass faded,
man-made lakes were filled with geese like airports
on water. Even in the midst of so much beauty
there is no place that will save us. Our destination
is between suffering and joy, everything else is a road
filled with unending patience. And even I, a nomad,
who has witnessed so much of the world,
will be forgotten before I reach the veranda
of my homeland, and yet as I watched the last light
of evening, waiting for the bus, I saw them, the dead,
descending on wings, joining the birds to play
in water like little children, laughing into joy,
and then they were gone. All that was left
was the only freedom we could speak without shame,
the weather, winter, the harmony of all things."

Healing Will Come: Elegy after Natural Disaster,Patricia Jabbeh Wesley,"She searches the ruins like someone
who has wandered so far away.

Six children, I had six children,
she tells herself. All around, her world
has become twigs of splintered pieces
of a long-ago life,
not so long ago.

She lays down one child alongside another
child, alongside another,
but then, she stands there, wiping her
eyes, looking ahead, turning over

the ruins of pieces of a place that once
was, in the ruins of a life that once was.
But they were six children, she says,
six, dead, or alive.

A mother knows what it means
to have six, not three, but six living
children, not three only, dead,
and there, the tears, calming for now,
calming, for now.
Always.

What would I do without tears,
I used to ask myself in another world.
What would she do without tears,
I now ask myself, and now,
the water from her eyes, unlike
the water that has taken
everything away with it.

Somewhere, always, somewhere,
there’s a day when healing comes.
Wasn’t this what life was supposed to bring,
after death, the healing?
Healing refuses to be lost to death,

Red Meat: Fragments of Stesichoros,Anne Carson,"I. GERYON

Geryon was a monster everything about him was red
Put his snout out of the covers in the morning it was red
How stiff the red landscape where his cattle scraped against
Their hobbles in the red wind
Burrowed himself down in the red dawn jelly of Geryon's
Dream

Geryon's dream began red then slipped out of the vat and ran
Upsail broke silver shot up through his roots like a pup

Secret pup At the front end of another red day



II. MEANWHILE HE CAME

Across the salt knobs it was Him
Knew about the homegold
Had sighted red smoke above the red spires



III. GERYON'S PARENTS

If you persist in wearing your mask at the supper table
Well Goodnight Then they said and drove him up
Those hemorrhaging stairs to the hot dry Arms
To the ticking red taxi of the incubus
Don't want to go want to stay Downstairs and read



IV. GERYON'S DEATH BEGINS

Geryon walked the red length of his mind and answered No
It was murder And torn to see the cattle lay
All these darlings said Geryon And now me



V. GERYON'S REVERSIBLE DESTINY

His mother saw it mothers are like that
Trust me she said Engineer of his softness
You don't have to make up your mind right away
Behind her red right cheek Geryon could see
Coil of the hot plate starting to glow



VI. MEANWHILE IN HEAVEN

Athena was looking down through the floor
Of the glass-bottomed boat Athena pointed
Zeus looked Him



VII. GERYON'S WEEKEND

Later well later they left the bar went back to the centaur's
Place the centaur had a cup made out of a skull Holding three
Measures of wine Holding it he drank Come over here you can
Bring your drink if you're afraid to come alone The centaur
Patted the sofa beside him Reddish yellow small alive animal
Not a bee moved up Geryon's spine on the inside



VIII. GERYON'S FATHER

A quiet root may know how to holler He liked to
Suck words Here is an almighty one he would say
After days of standing in the doorway
NIGHTBOLLSNORTED



IX. GERYON'S WAR RECORD

Geryon lay on the ground covering his ears The sound
Of the horses like roses being burned alive



X. SCHOOLING

In those days the police were weak Family was strong
Hand in hand the first day Geryon'ş mother took him to
School She neatened his little red wings and pushed him
In through the door



XI. RIGHT

Are there many little boys who think they are a
Monster? But in my case I am right said Geryon to the
Dog they were sitting on the bluffs The dog regarded him
Joyfully



XII. WINGS

Steps off a scraped March sky and sinks
Up into the blind Atlantic morning One small
Red dog jumping across the beach miles below
Like a freed shadow



XIII. HERAKLES' KILLING CLUB

Little red dog did not see it he felt it All
Events carry but one



XIV. HERAKLE'S ARROW

Arrow means kill It parted Geryon's skull like a comb Made
The boy neck lean At an odd slow angle sideways as when a
Poppy shames itself in a whip of Nude breeze



XV. TOTAL THINGS KNOWN ABOUT GERYON

He loved lightning He lived on an island His mother was a
Nymph of a river that ran to the sea His father was a gold
Cutting tool Old scholia say that Stesichoros says that
Geryon had six hands and six feet and wings He was red and
His strange red cattle excited envy Herakles came and
Killed him for his cattle

the confluence of the Chama and the Rio Grande.
  
 
 They say that Juan de Oñate y Salazar, who declared it, hoped to find other
riches—others’ riches—greater than those of the Mexica to the south.
  
 
 And one year later, his soldiers demanded from the Acoma the supplies
 
necessary to survive the winter.                                                 
 
And when they resisted because ceding to the demand would mean      
 
accepting their own death, Oñate decreed the murder of 800 of the      
 
Acoma, the enslavement of the remaining 500 women and children,      
 
and the amputation of the right foot of the 80 surviving men.                 
  
 
 They say that the wounded antelope will keep walking until it collapses in

They say that it originally referred to the Bolas de Plata region, brief pride
of the Spaniards during the first half of the eighteenth century, today a few
kilometers south of the border.

And the majority of their deaths are caused by exposure to
the elements, exhaustion, and lack of drinkable water.

unforgiving territories.

And agents are taught to trample the caches of water stashed

Sol Varp Sunnan,Unknown,"Sun from the south, Moon’s companion
cast her right hand over the sky’s rim.

Sun did not see who labored in her shade,
a gardener who had no heights to scale.

Sun did not know where she had a home,
yet the gardener’s hands found certainty in soil.

Stars did not know where they belonged,
while the gardener’s boots left prints in softened ground.

And as the gardener’s work broached heaven’s margin,
Moon did not know what strength she held.

Song,Unknown,"Why does my husband strike me,
forlorn thing I am?
I did not do wrong,
I did not misspeak,
save to urge him: alone, please,
leave my friend.
Why does my husband strike me,
forlorn thing I am?

And if he left me lonely,
no good life to lead,
I would proclaim such cuckold,
loud and clear indeed.
Why does my husband strike me,
forlorn thing I am?

Better still, here’s what I’d do
and how I’d seek revenge:
starkly in the nude I’d sleep,
cozy with my friend.

Why does my husband strike me,
forlorn thing I am?

Je ne li ai riens mesfait

Por quoi me bat mes maris,

Et s’il ne m’y lait durer

Por quoi me bat mes maris,

Or sai bien que je ferai

Song of a Girl Going to Bathe,Estevam Coelho,"If my friend only knew,
today he’d go too:
I’m off to the river to bathe,
by the sea.

If he only knew where,
he’d go with me there:
I’m off to the river to bathe,
by the sea.

My cape’s on my shoulders;
if only they’d told him:
I’m off to the river to bathe,
by the sea.

“cantiga de amigo”*

Se hoj’o meu amigo
soubess’, iria migo:
eu al rio me vou banhar,
e al mar.

Se hoj’el este dia
soubesse, migo iria:
eu al rio me vou banhar,
e al mar.

Quem lhi dissess’atanto:
ca já filhei o manto;
eu al rio me vou banhar,
e al mar.


* “cantiga de amigo” is not the title (the Galician-Portuguese cantigas—songs—were untitled) but the genre, and means roughly “song about/for a friend.” Further explanation is found in the translator’s note."
Song of the Boatman from Yueh,Liu Xiang,
The Spiders,Chelsea T. Hicks,"my functional heart, where are you
what turned you into an empty glass
is it that I love the spiders & am like one
wherever I go making my house
I have only to wait & all things come to me
& therein break their necks
but a calm & normal heart
where does that come from?

To the Sun God,Chase Berggrun,"Knees red from prayer
I sweat I swear I sick I
sorry skyward—

I see a finger in my mirror
aimed external—look
a little away and there, look
a less expensive solution

I seep gratefully into
words till words work
as well as they will

I remain imperfect clay
I lay an egg

Sometimes the walled city of grief reerects
Sometimes a door

God’s hair
peeks out slow
spurning trumpets

Beneath this light yes
and I am willing"
Topshe Fish with Eggs,Ishwar Gupta,"Though not a bird, you have attractive wings.
Your every limb is juicy, sweet.
Your flavour, once it fills the mouth,
makes other food taste like goo.

Cleaning you, scrubbing the scales, takes a while.
Can I have you raw? Right now, please?
To behold you is to forget even the son who’s died.
A whiff of you is a whole meal.

I buy you fresh, twenty at a time.
And eat you fast, deep fried in hot oil.

Versions from the Popol Vuh: An Excerpt,Unknown,"And here in this root-place we call K’iche’
we’re going to write down the words,
we’re going to write down the ancient words,
which are the source of everything done
here in this root-place called K’iche’.
And we’re going to teach, tell, show how
the world was made, how light was brought
by the Maker, the Shaper,
the Sustainer, the Origin who is named
Hunahpu Possum, Hunahpu Coyote,
Great White Peccary, Wide-Eyed Coati,
Lofty Feathered Snake, Heart of the Lake,
Heart of the Sea, Great Potter
of Plate and Bowl, and also called Midwife,
Matchmaker, Gatherer, named Xpiyacoc,
Xmucane, Guardian, Sponsor,
two times a midwife, two times a matchmaker—
all told as the story is told in K’iche’.
They made everything, thought of everything,
and they did it with the clarity of their being,
with the clarity of their words.
And we’re going to write about this now
even as Christianity spreads around us,
even as they talk about the one God.
We’re going to write these words down now
because there’s no longer
anywhere to find them, no Popol Vuh,
no place to see the light beyond the sea,
the story of our lives in the place of shadows,
the story of the beginning of things here.
And we’re going to write this down
from the original book, because those who
would teach it have hidden themselves.
It will take a long time, a long writing
to adequately relate how the sky was lit
and earth covered. To relate the fourfold
cornering, measuring, staking, halving the cord,
stretching the cord across the sky,
across the earth, from corner to corner,
says the ancient book, by the Maker,
the Shaper, the parent of existence,
laborer, provider of breath, of blood,
sustainer, nurturer in the light, bringer
of the light, worrier, knowing custodian
anywhere there are skies, anywhere
there are earthly lakes and seas.
Translated from the K’iche’"
The Wife’s Lament,Unknown,"I sing this song, full of sadness,
this song which is myself. I will tell, what I am able,
about what hardships I have faced—since I grew up,
recently or long ago, never more than now.
Always I suffer my misery of exile.
First my lord departed from my people,
over waves rolling; I had grief before dawn
thinking of the lands which held him, my people’s lord.
Then I set out, a friendless stranger, searching
for his retinue, because of my grievous need.
Relatives of this man began to plan
through secret thought that they would separate us,
that we as far apart as possible in the kingdom of the world
would live, wretchedly, and me longing.
My lord commanded me to take a grove for a house:
little of what is beloved to me did I possess in this country,
no loyal friends; for that is my mind’s sadness.
When I found the man who was my complete match,
he was unfortunate, sad of mind and heart,
with thoughts concealed, planning his crime
behind a joyful demeanor. Very often we vowed
that we would never be separated, not by death
or anything else; what was before is now changed,
is now as if it never were, that friendship
between us. Must I who desires you nearby
suffer, my dearly loved, this feud?
Commanded was I to dwell in a forest grove.
Under an oak tree, in a cave—the earth’s chest.
Old is this earth hall and I am filled with longing.
Here is a gloomy valley, treacherous hills,
bitter hedges, briars waxing, overgrown
in this house without joy. Very often my cruel departure
takes hold of me. Friends live on earth
lying in bed with their beloveds
while I in the time before dawn alone walk
under oak tree. In the earth’s chest
I sit many long summer days
weeping for the misery of exile
my many hardships; there I am never able
to rest from my mind’s grief
nor from all the longing that in this life takes hold of me.
It may be that he is always sorrowful,
his heart’s thoughts stern; perhaps he has
a joyful demeanor next to his grief,
its constant sorrowful tumult. Whether he is dependent on himself
for all of his worldly joy, or whether he is an outcast, very far
from his distant country, sitting
under stone cliffs frost-rimmed from storms,
friendless, water flowing before
his echoing home, my lover suffers
much grief of the mind. Too often he remembers
a house full of joy. Woe to those that must
of  longing in life abide.

The Black Finger,Angelina Weld Grimké,"I have just seen a most beautiful thing
Slim and still
Against a gold, gold sky,
A straight black cypress,
Sensitive,
Exquisite,
A black finger
Pointing upwards.
Why, beautiful still finger, are you black?
And why arc you pointing upwards?"
El Beso,Angelina Weld Grimké,"Twilight—and you,
Quiet—the stars;
Snare of the shine of your teeth,
Your provocative laughter,
The gloom of your hair;
Lure of you, eye and lip ;
Yearning, yearning,
Languor, surrender;
Your mouth,
And madness, madness,
Tremulous, breathless, flaming,
The space of a sigh;
Then awakening—remembrance,
Pain, regret—your sobbing;
And again quiet—the stars,
Twilight—and you."
Leaving Bents Fort,Lance Henson,"Leaving bents fort
For Floyd bringing good

Riding the high plains from Colorado
To Kansas

A whirlwind gaunt and alone crosses the landscape

I drive the truck south toward Oklahoma
Crossing the same path two moon and roman nose
Once wandered

I am on the edge

Barely in America

Somewhere between rage and freedom…"
What I Believe,Kimberly Blaeser,"I believe the weave of cotton
will support my father's knees,
but no indulgences will change hands.

I believe nothing folds easily,
but that time will crease—
retrain the mind.

I believe in the arrowheads of words
and I believe in silence.

I believe the rattle of birch leaves
can shake sorrow from my bones,
but that we all become bare at our own pace.

I believe the songs of childhood
follow us into the kettles of age,
but the echoes will not disturb the land.

I believe the reach of the kayak paddle
can part the blue corridor of aloneness,
and that eyes we see in water are never our own."
In Such a Way That,Eric Pankey,"Winter ends with a miscellany’s logic: a leaden horizon,
A narrow but unbridgeable distance.

Stolen moments are exchanged for isolated hours,
Elaborate entanglements, a lodging.

One’s suitable room fulfills a double assignment
As a stage and shelter. The heady pollen of stargazer lilies

Covers the bureaus, the desktop, and end tables.
Beyond the window, the sacred mountain

Is depleted of snow. On a frequency
At the far end of the dial, one can hear

Vespers, and recall the little Latin one learned long ago,
Knowing even then it would come in handy"
each translation is a transformation,Raquel Salas Rivera,"trans people know that each transformation
is as if they threw firecrackers
in our accordion veins
made of coming and going
from neighborhoods and families
that are more or less chosen
but when you drop a bomb
there are no translations
befores or afters

they dropped a ribbon to celebrate the anniversary
of everything working
things are going perfectly
the trees and the wind
still calm in the poems
like breezes or storms
a white woman dedicates things
to universal mothers

under the tutelage of melania
beatriz isabel records videos
where she shows us the great family
everything good in the verses
everyone busy discussing
if x or y representative
received our call

but the bombs don't represent
they are like the wind if the wind were a bomb
they don't call or let you know
they want coffee or are selling chocolate bars
in exchange for donations"
if time is queer/and memory is trans/and my hands hurt in the cold/then,Raquel Salas Rivera,"there are ways to hold pain like night follows day
not knowing how tomorrow went down.

it hurts like never when the always is now,
the now that time won't allow.

there is no manner of tomorrow, nor shape of today
only like always having to leave
from and toward the future's could-be,
in order to never more see
the sí;

and if forever proves me wrong,
it'll hurt with the hurt of before the before.
it'll have to take me along:
all the never-enough of why and therefore.

life has given me much to believe,
but more is the doubt that undid what i know,

for, like night follows day, the pleasure is sure,
of forever beginning once more."
my mother’s hands,Nate Marshall,"would moisturize
my face from jaw inward
the days she had too
much on her hands
when what needed
to come through
did or didn't show.
she still shone, still made
smooth her every rough
edge, heel to brow.
hugged my temples
with slick hands,
as if to say son be mine
as if to say this i give you
as if to say we are people
color of good oak but we
will not burn, we survive
every fire without becoming
ash."
They,Raquel Salas Rivera,"what do we eat when a name dies?
yesterday your mother stopped by, but she didn't
recognize me as your friend's friend, the previous one.
what is that about, having a dead friend
in the wallet with a picture of a kidnapped kid?
have you seen my son?
he is short and collects photos of swings.

my short hair isn't professional;
your long hair doesn't prepare you.
between the two of us, we figure out how
to fake we are marionettes, not people.
it's difficult to count the days
since the last time we went out.

what is that about, going out
and not having to explain
you aren't that her
or that thing?

in this, our language,1
there exists no plural that doesn't deny me.
